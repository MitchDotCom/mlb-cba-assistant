Page"},{"page":15,"text":"2022–2026 BASIC AGREEMENT  This   Agreement,   effective   March   10,   2022,   is   between   the 30 Major League Clubs and the Major League Baseball Players Association (hereinafter referred to as the “Players Association” or the “Association”). In making this Agreement the Association represents that it contracts for and on behalf of the Major League Baseball Players and individuals who may become Major League Baseball Players during the term of this Agreement, and the Clubs represent that they contract for and on behalf of themselves, any additional Clubs which may become mem- bers of the Major Leagues and the successors thereof.  ARTICLE I—Intent and Purpose  The intent and purpose of the Clubs and the Association (hereinafter “the Parties”) in entering into this Agreement is to set forth their agree- ment on certain terms and conditions of employment of all Major League Baseball Players for the duration of this Agreement. Each of the Parties acknowledges the rights and responsibilities of the other Party and agrees to discharge its responsibilities under this Agreement.  ARTICLE II—Recognition  The Clubs recognize the Association as the sole and exclusive collec- tive bargaining agent for all Major League Players, and individuals who may become Major League Players during the term of this Agree- ment, with regard to all terms and conditions of employment, provided that an individual Player shall be entitled to negotiate in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Agreement (1) an individual salary over and above the minimum requirements established by this Agree- ment and (2) Special Covenants to be included in an individual Uni- form   Player’s   Contract,   which   actually   or   potentially   provide additional benefits to the Player.  ARTICLE III—Uniform Player’s Contract  The form of the Uniform Player’s Contract between a Club and a Player is attached hereto as Appendix A, which is incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof. 1"},{"page":16,"text":"During the term of this Agreement, no other form of Uniform Player’s Contract will be utilized. Should the provisions of any Contract between any individual Player and any of the Clubs be inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern. Subject to the limitations set forth in Article IV below, nothing herein contained shall limit the right of any Club and Player to enter into Special Covenants in the space provided in a manner not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement. The termination of this Agreement shall not impair, limit or terminate the rights and duties of any Club or Player under any Contract between any individual Player and any of the Clubs.  ARTICLE IV—Negotiation and Approval of Contracts  A Player, if he so desires, may designate an agent to conduct on his behalf, or to assist him in, the negotiation of an individual salary and/or Special Covenants to be included in his Uniform Player’s Con- tract with any Club, provided such agent has been certified to the Clubs by the Association as authorized to act as a Player Agent for such purposes. The Association shall provide the Office of the Commissioner with a comprehensive list of the certified Player Agent(s) whom each Player has designated to act on his behalf for the purposes described in this Article IV. The Association also shall provide the Office of the Com- missioner with any changes to such Player Agent designations, includ- ing the Player Agent designations of Players who have been added to a Major League roster, on a weekly basis. In addition, the Association will provide the Office of the Commissioner with notice of any revi- sions to its regulations governing Player Agents, and a complete copy of the revised regulations. If the Association has notified the Office of the Commissioner that a Player has designated a certified Player Agent or Agents to act on his behalf for the purposes described in this Article IV, no Club may nego- tiate or attempt to negotiate an individual salary and/or Special Covenants to be included in a Uniform Player’s Contract with any Player Agent(s) other than such Player Agent(s). No agent designation shall be considered effective unless it was transmitted from the Asso- ciation to the Office of the Commissioner. 2"},{"page":17,"text":"A Club may require a Player’s physical presence only once during con- tract negotiations. This limitation shall not apply to telephone confer- ence calls, at reasonable times, with a Player and his certified Player Agent. A Player required to be physically present during negotiations during the offseason shall be entitled to be paid by the Club for round- trip first-class transportation and first-class hotel costs, and a daily meal and tip allowance, at the same rate as the in-season meal and tip allowance provided under Article VII(B) for the immediately preced- ing season, for that day and any additional travel days. Upon execution of a Uniform Player’s Contract by the Club and Player, the Club promptly shall submit the Contract, in duplicate, to the Commissioner for approval. Within 20 days of receipt, the Com- missioner shall approve or disapprove the Contract (with notice to the Association), or provide the Association with a written explanation of why the Contract has not been approved. This period is extended to 30 days if a Contract is received by the Commissioner between Feb- ruary 15 and April 15. Within ten days after the Commissioner is to provide an explanation of why a Contract has not been approved, the Commissioner shall approve or disapprove the Contract. (See Attach- ment l.) Any Grievance challenging the Commissioner’s conduct under this Article shall be handled by the Parties on an expedited basis with documents being exchanged within 10 days of the filing of the Grievance, a hearing commencing within 15 days of the filing of the Grievance and the Panel issuing an Award (with an opinion to follow, if necessary) no later than 15 days following the commencement of the hearing. The Office of the Commissioner will provide copies of all newly signed and approved Uniform Player’s Contracts as frequently as is feasible, but no less frequently than on a monthly basis. Contracts not yet approved or disapproved by the Commissioner will be made avail- able to the Association upon its request.  ARTICLE V—Scheduling A.   Length of Season  During the term of this Agreement, each Club shall be scheduled to play 162 games during each championship season. Each championship season will not be scheduled over a period of less than 182 days or 3"},{"page":18,"text":"more than 187 days. If, however, any Club’s championship season is scheduled to open with a game played outside of the United States and Canada, and the scheduling of such a game causes the championship season for those Clubs to be scheduled over a period of more than 187 days (an “International Opener”), then the championship season for all other Clubs shall commence on the date of the first regularly scheduled championship season game within the 187 days preceding the regu- larly scheduled end of the championship season. See Article VI(C). Following completion of each championship season, twelve Clubs shall qualify for Post-Season play: the three Division Champions in each League and the three other Clubs in each League with the highest percentage of wins in the championship season (“Wild Card Clubs”). In each League, the two Division Champions with the highest percent- age (first seed) and second-highest percentage of wins (second seed) during the championship season will receive first-round byes and auto- matically advance to the Division Series. The four remaining Clubs in each League (the remaining Division Champion and the three Wild Card Clubs) shall engage in a best of three Wild Card Series. There- after, the two winners of the Wild Card Series in each League and the Division Champions that received byes for the Wild Card Series shall engage in a best of five (seven if the Division Series is expanded) Divi- sion Series. See Attachment 25. The winners of the Division Series in each League shall then engage in a best of seven League Champion- ship Series, and the winners of the two League Championship Series shall engage in a best of seven World Series. If during the term of this Agreement the format of the Wild Card Series, the Division Series, the League Championship Series or the World Series is proposed to be changed, the Clubs shall give the Association notice thereof and shall negotiate the proposed change with the Association; provided, how- ever, that if during the term of this Agreement the Division Series is proposed to be changed to the best of seven games, the Clubs shall give the Association notice thereof and shall negotiate with the Association but the Clubs shall not be required to negotiate with the Association over contributions to the Players’ pool beyond those specified in Article X. Any failure to play the Wild Card Series, the Division Series, the League Championship Series or the World Series, in whole or in part, by reason of causes beyond the control of the Clubs, shall not constitute a change in the format of such Series or a breach of this Agreement. 4"},{"page":19,"text":"During any negotiations between the Parties on the subject of a renewal of or successor to this Agreement, the Clubs agree that any proposal made by the Association to reduce the number of championship season games shall not be resisted on the ground of commitments made by the Clubs in local television and radio contracts. However, nothing herein shall interfere with or limit the right of the Clubs to resist such proposal on any other ground or the right of either Party to take any other position in future negotiations on this or any other proper subject for collective bargaining.  B.   Championship Schedules  Each year, copies of the tentative championship schedules of the Major Leagues for the next ensuing season shall be submitted to the Associ- ation for review. The Office of the Commissioner will use best efforts to include times of games in the tentative schedule, and to minimize miles traveled over the course of the championship season. The Asso- ciation shall complete its review of the tentative schedule within thirty (30) days, at which point, after considering any feedback from the Association in good faith (including potential changes to game dates or game times), the Office of the Commissioner may publicly release the schedule. Thereafter, the Office of the Commissioner will promptly notify the Association of additional proposed games times not already provided, and any changes in the tentative championship schedules submitted to the Association above. The Office of the Commissioner will consider any feedback from the Association (including potential changes to game dates or game times) prior to finalizing game times in the championship schedule. The Association’s initial feedback pro- vided consistent with this Article V(B) shall not constitute a waiver of any rights pursuant to the Basic Agreement or any other agreement.  C.   Additional Scheduling Agreements  (1) Split doubleheaders may be included in the original schedule pursuant to Section C(14) below. Provided that neither of the Clubs involved in the proposed rescheduled game has already played or has been rescheduled to play a total of three split doubleheaders (exclusive of any splits in the original schedule) in that champion - ship season: 5"},{"page":20,"text":"(a) each Club shall have the right to reschedule any postponed game as a split doubleheader when ticket sales for the game at the time of postponement exceed, in any respect, the number of com- parable tickets available to be exchanged by the Club for the bal- ance of the championship season, and both the postponed and rescheduled game occur in the last regularly scheduled series between the two Clubs at the Club’s park; and (b)   when there is no practical alternative to doing so, the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs shall have the right to reschedule a postponed game as a split doubleheader to be played in, respectively, Fenway Park and Wrigley Field, even if the cri- teria set out in subparagraph (a) above are not met. Scheduling a postponed game as part of a conventional doubleheader will not be considered a practical alternative. The Association shall have the exclusive right to approve the addi- tional rescheduling of postponed games as split doubleheaders in circumstances that are not automatically permitted by subparagraph (a) or (b) above. If the Association agrees to a split doubleheader pursuant to the preceding sentence, it shall be scheduled for the visiting Club’s next visit to the home Club’s park absent good cause and agreement between the Office of the Commissioner and the Association. (2) One-day stands will not be scheduled except as doubleheaders (to be followed by an open day) or as “openers,” provided that any game played on the day following the opener does not start before 4 P.M. A game will not be rescheduled as a one-game stand except as required to complete the championship schedule. (3) During the championship season, no Club shall be scheduled to play an exhibition game. For purposes of this paragraph (3), a Spring Training or pre-season exhibition game that is scheduled to commence at least three hours before the start of the first champion- ship season game shall not be considered played “during the championship season.” (4) There shall be one off-day with no workouts scheduled either after a Club breaks Spring Training camp and before the final pre- season exhibition game, or between the last Spring Training or pre- season exhibition game and the first championship season game. 6"},{"page":21,"text":"Notwithstanding the foregoing, this off-day may be scheduled the day after the Club opens the championship season if the Club is selected to play on the first day of the championship season and the first day of the championship season has five or fewer games. If the off-day occurs after the start of the championship season, the Club may hold a voluntary workout or travel on the off-day. If the off-day occurs prior to the start of the championship season, a Club may not hold a workout, voluntary or otherwise. (5) The following shall apply to the scheduling or rescheduling of games prior to day doubleheaders: (a) a game will not be scheduled to start after 5 P.M. if either Club is scheduled to play a day doubleheader the next day; and (b)   a game will not be rescheduled to start after 5 P.M. if either Club is scheduled to play a day doubleheader the next day unless such rescheduling is necessary to complete the champion- ship schedule. (6)   Day games shall not be scheduled or (unless necessary to complete the championship schedule) rescheduled to start before 1 P.M., except as provided in paragraph (7) below, and except that such games may be scheduled or rescheduled to start between Noon and 1 P.M., if each Club meets one of the following two conditions: (a) if an off-day occurred the previous day; or (b) if a game were played in the same city within the previous 24 hours. Day games may be scheduled or rescheduled to start between Noon and 1 P.M. on holidays if each Club meets one of the above con- ditions or if an afternoon game starting not later than 5 P.M. or a doubleheader starting not later than 1:30 P.M. was played in another city the previous day and the in-flight time required is 1   1 / 2   hours or less. Notwithstanding the foregoing, day games may start at Noon on the Opening Day of the championship season. (7)   With the approval of the Commissioner, not more than 4 games per League per year may be scheduled or rescheduled to start between 10:30 A.M. and Noon, if, with respect to both Clubs, the 7"},{"page":22,"text":"conditions stated in paragraph (6) above with respect to scheduling and rescheduling of day games between Noon and l P.M. are met. (8)   The latest possible start time for getaway games on days when the visiting Club travels to a home off-day or either Club trav- els to another game the following day shall be determined by taking the portion of the in-flight time that exceeds 2 1/2 hours, and sub- tracting that amount of time from 7 P.M. However, the foregoing sentence shall not apply to getaway games that are broadcast on ESPN’s “Sunday Night Baseball” or rescheduled games. Additionally, each Club that is limited by its stadium lease agree- ment or governmental regulation in the number of day games it may play shall receive one exception annually to the rules set forth in this Article V(C)(8), provided that the Club has applied for and has been denied a waiver by its lessor or the relevant governmental authority. All references to “in-flight time” in this Article V shall be as set forth in Appendix C.

(10) Clubs shall consult with their Player Representatives prior to the start of the season when determining whether to travel to a road game immediately upon the conclusion of a day game that is followed by an off-day or, alternatively, to travel on the off-day. (11) An open day shall be scheduled where travel from cities in the Pacific Time Zone to cities in the Eastern Time Zone is required except that the Office of the Commissioner may schedule up to seven games per championship season in each League with a starting time 8"},{"page":23,"text":"after 7 P.M. in the Eastern Time Zone which include a Club that the day before played a game scheduled to start prior to 5 P.M. in the Pacific Time Zone.

B.   Maximum Salary Reduction  (1)   Maximum Salary Cut Rule  A Club may not tender, sign or renew a Player under reserve to the Club pursuant to Article XX(A) of this Agreement and para- graph 10(a) of the Uniform Player’s Contract to a Uniform Player’s Contract that provides a salary for: (a)   Major   League   service   that   constitutes   a   reduction   in excess of 20% of his salary for Major League service in the pre- vious season or in excess of 30% of his salary for Major League service two seasons prior to the first season covered by the new contract; or (b)   Minor League service as calculated under Section 2(c) below that constitutes a reduction in excess of 50% of his salary for Minor League service in the previous season. (2)   Calculation of Previous Seasons Salaries  (a) Single-Year Contract—Previous Major League Salaries In order to calculate a Player’s salary for Major League service in the previous season or two seasons prior to the first season covered by the new contract, the following steps shall be taken: (i)   Base Salary.   The Player’s “Base Salary” shall be the rate of pay for Major League service contained in paragraph 2 of the contract, or in any special covenant thereto. The Base Salary   shall   be   adjusted   in   accordance   with   paragraphs 2(a)(ii)-(v) below to determine the Player’s salary. (ii)   Deferred Compensation Adjustment.   If any deferred compensation is included in the Base Salary, the Base Salary shall be adjusted to reflect the discounted present value of the deferred amount. 12"},{"page":27,"text":"(iii) Signing Bonus Adjustment.   If the contract contains a signing bonus, the signing bonus shall be added to the Base Salary. If any portion of the signing bonus is deferred, the present value of the signing bonus shall be used for purposes of the calculation in this paragraph 2(a)(iii). (iv) Performance Bonus Adjustment.   If the contract con- tains performance bonuses, regardless of whether or not any portion of the bonus is earned, the Club has the option of either adding the entire bonus (both earned and unearned portions) in the Base Salary, or excluding it from the Base Salary but repeating the bonus on the same terms. (v) Other Forms of Compensation Adjustment.   If the con- tract contains any other forms of compensation, the determina- tion of whether the compensation shall be included in the salary calculation will be determined in accordance with the facts in each situation. Amounts that are payable on the occur- rence of a specific event or events shall not be included in Base Salary if such event or events fail to occur within the specified period. If the item is included, the Club has the option of either including the value of the item in the Base Salary, or excluding it from Base Salary but repeating the item on the same terms. The following is a nonexhaustive list of other forms of com- pensation: (A) payments for performing services for a Club in addi- tion to skilled services as a baseball player; (B) cash, lump sum, payments made in accordance with agreed upon special covenants to compensate for trading a Player, releasing a Player, etc.; (C) the value of individual property rights granted to a Player by a Club; (D)   any   compensation   for   postactive   Major   League Baseball playing career employment; and (E)   other payments or things of value not specifically made for performance as a Major League Baseball Player. 13"},{"page":28,"text":"(b) Multi-Year Contract—Previous Major League Salaries In order to calculate a Player’s salary for Major League service in the previous season or two seasons prior to the first season covered by the new contract, the following steps shall be taken: (i) Base Salary (A) If the annual rates of pay contained in paragraph 2 of the contract, or in any special covenant thereto, satisfy the maximum salary cut rule, the rate of pay stipulated in the contract for the year at issue shall be the Player’s Base Salary. (B) If the annual rates of pay contained in paragraph 2 of the contract, or in any special covenant thereto, do not satisfy the maximum salary cut rule, the average annual value (“AAV”) of the contract shall be the Player’s Base Salary for the year at issue. The AAV shall be calculated by aver- aging the rates of pay contained in paragraph 2 of the con- tract (or any special covenants thereto) for each year of the contract. If deferred compensation is contained in any year of the multi-year contract, the present value of the deferred amount will be used for purposes of calculating the AAV. (C)   The Base Salary shall be adjusted in accordance with paragraphs 2(b)(ii)-(iv) below to determine a Player’s salary. (ii) Signing Bonus Adjustment.   If the contract contains a signing bonus, the bonus, irrespective of payment dates, shall be prorated and included in equal amounts as part of the Base Salary for each year of the contract. If any portion of the sign- ing bonus is deferred beyond the expiration of the contract, the present value of the signing bonus shall be used for purposes of the calculation in this paragraph 2(b)(ii). (iii)   Performance Bonus Adjustment.   If the year of the multi-year contract at issue contains performance bonuses, they shall be treated in the same manner as in paragraph 2(a)(iv) above.

If a single year contract, or the rel- evant year of a multi-year contract, does not contain a separate rate of pay for Minor League service, the Player’s salary for Minor League service in the previous season shall be deemed to be the same as his salary for performing Major League serv- ice as calculated pursuant to paragraph 2(a) or 2(b) above. (ii) Contracts that Contain a Separate Rate of Pay for Minor League Service. (A)   If a single-year contract, or the relevant year of a multi-year contract, contains a separate rate of pay for Minor League service, and the rate of pay is higher than the Major League minimum salary for the preceding season contained in Article VI(A)(1), the Player’s salary for Minor League service in the previous season shall be the rate of pay for Minor League service that is stipulated in the con- tract. For purposes of this paragraph 2(c)(ii)(A), the stipu- lated rate of pay for Minor League service contained in the contract shall not be adjusted to account for a signing bonus, performance or award bonuses, or any other forms of compensation provided for by the contract. (B) If a single-year contract, or the relevant year of a multi-year contract, contains a separate rate of pay for Minor League service, and that rate of pay is lower than the Major League minimum salary for the prior season contained in Article VI(A)(1), the Player’s salary for Minor League service in the previous season shall be the greater of the total amount of the Player’s actual baseball salary earnings (defined below) in that season, or the rate of pay stipulated for Minor League service in the Player’s contract for that season.

(d) Fines or Suspensions The calculation of a Player’s previous year salaries shall include amounts which were not paid to a Player for the season by reason of any fine or suspension which may have been imposed on the Player, or by reason of any deduction from salary. (e) Option Years Option years shall be included as a year of the contract if the option had been fully exercised at the time of the tender, signing or renewal. (f) Pre-Arbitration Performance Bonus Program Amounts earned pursuant to the Pre-Arbitration Performance Bonus Program described in Article XV(D) shall not be included in the calculation of any Player’s previous year salaries (or for any other purpose pursuant to this Section B). (3)   Disputes  In the event of a dispute regarding a contract tender, signing or renewal with respect to any form of additional compensation referred to in paragraph (2)(a)(v) or 2(b)(iv) above, either the Player or Club may file a Grievance in order to obtain a determi- nation with respect thereto as the exclusive means of resolving such dispute, and both Parties shall be bound by the resulting decision. The contract tender, signing or renewal shall be altered as necessary to conform to the decision, and such tender, signing or renewal shall remain valid.  C.   Standard Length of Season  For the purpose of calculating a Player’s daily rate of pay, a champion- ship season shall be deemed to commence on the date of the first reg- 16"},{"page":31,"text":"ularly scheduled championship season game and to conclude on the date of the last regularly scheduled championship season game.

E.   Salary Arbitration  The following salary arbitration procedure shall be applicable: (1)   Eligibility . (a)   General Rule.   Any Player with a total of three or more years of Major League service, however accumulated, but with less than six years of Major League service, may submit the issue of the Player’s salary to final and binding arbitration without the consent of the Club, subject to the provisions of paragraph (3) below. Nothing contained herein shall limit the right of any Player, with the consent of the Club, to submit the issue of his salary to final and binding arbitration. (b) “Super Two” Players.   In addition, a Player with at least two but less than three years of Major League service shall be eli- gible for salary arbitration if: (a) he has accumulated at least 86 days of service during the immediately preceding season; and (b) he ranks in the top 22% (rounded to the nearest whole number) in total service in the class of Players who have at least two but less than three years of Major League service, however accumu- lated, but with at least 86 days of service accumulated during the immediately preceding season. If two or more Players are tied at 22%, all such Players shall be eligible.

In the event they are unable to agree by January 1 in any year, they jointly shall request that the American Arbitration Association furnish them lists of prominent, profes- sional arbitrators. Upon receipt of such lists, the arbitrators shall be selected by alternately striking names from the lists. All cases shall be assigned to three-arbitrator panels. The Association and the LRD shall designate one arbitrator to serve as the panel chair. (6)   Location of Hearings .   The single hearing site for each year will be agreed upon by the Parties with preference being given to either Tampa/St. Petersburg or Phoenix. (7)   Conduct of Hearings .   The hearings shall be conducted on a private and confidential basis. Each of the parties to a case shall be limited to one hour for initial presentation and one-half hour for rebuttal and summation. Cross-examination of witnesses shall not count against the aforesaid time limitations, and such time limita- tions may be extended by the arbitration panel for good cause. The Parties shall exchange all written materials to be utilized in their respective initial presentations at the outset of a hearing. The order of presentation shall be as follows: (a) Player’s initial presentation; (b) Club’s initial presentation; (c) Player’s rebuttal and summation; (d) Club’s rebuttal and summation; (e) Player’s surrebuttal, which shall be very brief and offered to respond to new issues raised during the Club’s rebuttal; and (f) If requested by the Club, the Panel may, at its discretion, allow the Club very brief surrebuttal to respond to new issues raised by the Player. 19"},{"page":34,"text":"Notwithstanding this order of presentation, neither party shall carry the burden of proof.

Any request for the postponement of a scheduled hearing shall be made to the panel chair in writing, with copies to the Association and the LRD. Disclosure of individual votes by panel members shall be in accordance with paragraph (13) below. (9)   Hearing Costs .   The Player and Club shall divide equally the costs of the hearing, and each shall be responsible for his own expenses and those of his counsel or other representatives. (10)   Criteria  (a)   The criteria will be the quality of the Player’s contribu- tion to his Club during the past season (including but not limited to his overall performance, special qualities of leadership and public appeal), the length and consistency of his career contribu- tion, the record of the Player’s past compensation, comparative baseball salaries (see paragraph (11) below for confidential salary data), the existence of any physical or mental defects on the part of the Player, and the recent performance record of the Club including but not limited to its League standing and atten- dance as an indication of public acceptance (subject to the exclu- sion stated in subparagraph (b)(i) below). Except as set forth in subsections 10(b) and 10(c) below, any evidence may be submit- ted which is relevant to the above criteria, and the arbitration panel shall assign such weight to the evidence as shall appear appropriate under the circumstances. The arbitration panel shall, except for a Player with five or more years of Major League service, give particular attention, for comparative salary pur- poses, to the contracts of Players with Major League service not exceeding one annual service group above the Player’s annual service group. This shall not limit the ability of a Player or his representative, because of special accomplishment, to argue the 20"},{"page":35,"text":"equal relevance of salaries of Players without regard to service, and the arbitration panel shall give whatever weight to such argument as is deemed appropriate. (b) Evidence of the following shall not be admissible: (i) The financial position of the Player and the Club; (ii) Press comments, testimonials or similar material bear- ing on the performance of either the Player or the Club, except that recognized annual Player awards for playing excellence shall not be excluded; (iii) Offers made by either Player or Club prior to arbitra- tion; (iv)   The cost to the Parties of their representatives, attor- neys, etc.; (v) Salaries in other sports or occupations; (vi)   The   existence   of   the   Pre-Arbitration   Performance Bonus Program described in Article XV(D), including the cri- teria and any amounts earned pursuant to the Program; (vii)   The potential impact of the hearing on the Player’s eligibility for termination pay under paragraph (3) above. (c)   Admissible Statistics.   Only publicly available statistics shall be admissible.

Statistics and data generated through the use of performance technology, wearable technology, or “STATCAST”, whether publicly available or not, shall not be admissible. (11)   Confidential Major League Salary Data .   For its confiden- tial use, as background information, the arbitration panel will be given a tabulation showing the minimum salary in the Major Leagues and salaries for the preceding season of all players on Major League rosters as of August 31, broken down by years of Major League service. The names and Clubs of the Players con- cerned will appear on the tabulation.

No par- ticipant in a salary arbitration shall refer in any fashion, either orally or in writing, to any of the provisions in Article XXIII (Competitive Balance Tax). No salary arbitration panel shall consider in any fash- ion any of the provisions in Article XXIII (Competitive Balance Tax). (13)   Timetable   and   Decision.   Within   five   days   after   the Exchange Date, the Association and LRD will meet to schedule the arbitration hearings for dates between January 26 to February 20, absent a contrary agreement of the Parties. The arbitration panel may render the decision on the day of the hearing, and shall make every effort to do so not later than 24 hours following the close of the hearing.

Each Player traveling with his Club on the road shall have sin- gle rooms in the Club’s hotels on all road trips during the Club’s Spring Training, championship season and post-season. Nothing herein shall prohibit the Clubs from making or continuing agree- ments   with   individual   Players   that   provide   more   favorable arrangements for such Players. (c)   Bus Travel.   During the championship season, including travel to the first game of such season, no Club, absent extraordi- nary circumstances that make travel by plane impossible, may travel by bus between games if the distance between the two cities is, by the most direct highway route, more than 200 miles (one way). 23"},{"page":38,"text":"During   the   championship   season,   the   visiting   Club   shall schedule two bus trips to transport Players from the team hotel to the ballpark for each game.

No deductions will be made for meals served on an airplane. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Players shall not be entitled to the in-season meal and tip allowance when the Club is on the road in the Club’s home city unless the Club elects to stay at a hotel while on the road in its home city.

Definitions  As used herein, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated: (1) (a) “Grievance” shall mean a complaint which involves the existence or interpretation of, or compliance with, any agreement, or any provision of any agreement, between the Association and the Clubs or any of them, or between a Player and a Club, except that disputes relating to the following agreements between the Associa- tion and the Clubs shall not be subject to the Grievance Procedure set forth herein: (i) The Major League Baseball Players Benefit Plan; (ii) The Agreement re Major League Baseball Players Ben- efit Plan; and (iii) The Agreement regarding dues check-off. Any procedures or remedies available to the Parties for the resolu- tion of disputes arising under said agreements that were available as of their respective execution dates shall continue to be available and not be altered or abridged in any way as a result of this Basic Agree- ment between the Association and the Clubs. (b) Notwithstanding the definition of “Grievance” set forth in subparagraph (a) above, “Grievance” shall not mean a complaint which involves action taken with respect to a Player or Players by the Commissioner involving the preservation of the integrity of, or the maintenance of public confidence in, the game of baseball. Within 30 days of the date of the action taken, such complaint shall be presented to the Commissioner who promptly shall con- duct a hearing in accordance with the Rules of Procedure attached hereto as Appendix B. The Commissioner shall render a written decision as soon as practicable following the conclusion of such hearing. The Commissioner’s decision shall constitute full, final and complete disposition of such complaint, and shall have the same effect as a Grievance decision of the Arbitration Panel. In the event a matter filed as a Grievance in accordance with the procedure hereinafter provided in Section B gives rise to issues involving the integrity of, or public confidence in, the game of baseball, the Commissioner may, at any stage of its pro- cessing, order that the matter be withdrawn from such procedure 41"},{"page":56,"text":"and thereafter be processed in accordance with the procedure provided above in this subparagraph (b). The order of the Com- missioner withdrawing such matter shall constitute a final deter- mination of the procedure to be followed for the exclusive and complete disposition of such matter, and such order shall have the same effect as a Grievance decision of the Arbitration Panel. (See also Attachment 1.) The Association may reopen this Agreement, with reference solely to Section A(1)(b) and Section C of this Article, upon the giving of 10 days’ written notice at any time, based upon experience under the aforesaid Sections which, in its opinion, is unsatisfactory. Any reopening notice served by the Association, in accordance with the foregoing, will be based only on actual experience with the operation of such Sections in the processing of Grievances or complaints and such reopening cannot occur unless there is actual experience under such Sections. Also, in the event that the incumbent Senior Vice President, On- Field Operations (or comparable title/position) or the incumbent Special Assistant to the Commissioner leaves that Office, the Association may reopen this Agreement, with reference solely to Section C of this Article as it affects the role of the Senior Vice President, On-Field Operations (or comparable title/position) or the Special Assistant to the Commissioner, upon the giving of 10 days’ written notice. (c) Notwithstanding the definition of “Grievance” set forth in subparagraph (a) above, “Grievance” shall not mean a complaint or dispute which involves the interpretation or application of, or compliance with the provisions of the first sentence of paragraph 3(c) of the Uniform Player’s Contract. However, nothing herein shall alter or abridge the rights of the Parties, or any of them, to resort to a court of law for the resolution of such complaint or dispute. Anything in the Grievance Procedure provided for in the Basic Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, complaints or dis- putes as to any rights of the Players or the Clubs with respect to the sale or proceeds of sale of radio or television broadcasting 42"},{"page":57,"text":"rights in any baseball games by any kind or method of transmis- sion, dissemination or reception shall not be subject to said Grievance Procedure. However, nothing herein or in the Griev- ance Procedure shall alter or abridge the rights of the Parties, or any of them, to resort to a court of law for the resolution of such complaint or dispute. The reference herein to the above types of complaints or disputes shall not be deemed to define exclusively the types of complaints or disputes which are not subject to said Grievance Procedure. (2) “League” shall mean The American League of Professional Baseball Clubs or The National League of Professional Baseball Clubs. (3)   “Commissioner” shall mean the person holding the office of Commissioner of Baseball as defined in the Major League Constitution. (4) “Player” or “Players” shall mean a Player or Players on the active roster of a Major League Club or on an injured, restricted, administrative leave, ineligible, suspended or military list of a Major League Club. The term “Player” shall also include a former Player or Players who have a grievance or complaint arising by rea- son of their former status as a Player as defined in the preceding sentence.

(7)   “Labor Relations Department” or “LRD” shall mean the Major League Baseball Labor Relations Department established by the Clubs, or any department of the Commissioner’s Office that assumes on behalf of the Commissioner the responsibilities formerly held by the Major League Baseball Player Relations Committee. (8)   “Grievant” shall mean a party who initiates or appeals a Grievance. (9)   “Arbitration Panel” shall mean the impartial arbitrator or, where either Party elects in advance of the opening of the hearing in a matter, a tripartite panel so empowered and composed of the 43"},{"page":58,"text":"impartial arbitrator and two party arbitrators, one appointed by the Association, the other appointed by the LRD. The impartial arbitra- tor, who shall in all instances be designated as the Panel Chair, shall be appointed by agreement of the Association and the LRD. In the event the Association and the LRD are unable to agree upon the appointment of the impartial arbitrator, they jointly shall request that the American Arbitration Association furnish them a list of prominent, professional arbitrators. Upon receipt of said list, they shall alternate in striking names from the list until only one remains. The arbitrator whose name remains shall be deemed appointed as the impartial arbitrator. At any time during the term of this Agreement either the Association or the LRD may terminate the appointment of the impartial arbitra- tor by serving written notice upon the impartial arbitrator and the other Party; provided that no such termination shall in any way impair the authority of the impartial arbitrator to render awards with respect to matters fully submitted to that impartial arbitrator. Within 30 days of any such termination, the Association and LRD shall either agree upon a successor impartial arbitrator or select a succes- sor from an American Arbitration Association list, as set forth above. Decisions of the Arbitration Panel shall be made by the impartial arbitrator or, where the panel is tripartite, by majority vote. (10) “Alternate Panel Chairs” shall mean the two impartial arbi- trators appointed for cases that cannot be scheduled for hearing by the Panel Chair within the time limit set forth in Section B below. Selection and termination of the Alternate Panel Chairs shall be by the same procedures utilized for selection and termination of the Panel Chair.  B.   Procedure Step 1 .   Any Player who believes that he has a justifiable Grievance shall first discuss the matter with a representative of his Club desig- nated to handle such matters, in an attempt to settle it. If the matter is not resolved as a result of such discussions, a written notice of the Grievance shall be presented to the Club’s designated representative; provided, however, that for a Grievance to be considered beyond Step 1, 44"},{"page":59,"text":"such written notice shall be presented within (a) 45 days from the date of the occurrence upon which the Grievance is based, or (b) 45 days from the date on which the facts of the matter became known or rea- sonably should have become known to the Player, whichever is later. Within 10 days following receipt of such written notice (within 2 days if disciplinary suspension or a Grievance involving Player safety and health), the Club’s designated representative shall advise the Player in writing of his decision and shall furnish a copy to the Association. If the decision of the Club is not appealed further within 15 days of its receipt, the Grievance shall be considered settled on the basis of that decision and shall not be eligible for further appeal.  Step 2 .   A Grievance, to be considered in Step 2, shall be appealed in writing by the Grievant or by the Association to a designated represen- tative of the LRD within 15 days following receipt of the Club’s writ- ten decision. Grievances which involve (a) more than one Club, or (b) a Player who is not under contract to a Club that is party to the Griev- ance, may be filed initially in Step 2, provided that written notice of the Grievance shall be presented to the designated representative of the LRD within (a) 30 days from the date of the occurrence upon which the Grievance is based, or (b) 30 days from the date on which the facts of the matter became known or reasonably should have become known to the Player, whichever is later. A Grievance appealed to or filed at Step 2 shall be discussed within 35 days thereafter (within 2 days if disciplinary suspension or a Grievance involving Player safety and health) between representatives of the LRD and representatives of the Association in an attempt to settle it. If both Parties agree, the Player and Club principals will also participate in the Step 2 meeting. The Parties will attempt to exchange documents in advance of the Step 2 meeting but the meeting shall occur within 35 days even if documents have not been exchanged by that date. Within 10 days following such meeting (within 2 days if disciplinary suspension or a Grievance involving Player safety and health), the designated representative of the LRD shall advise the Grievant in writing of his decision and shall furnish a copy to the Association. If the decision of the LRD represen- tative is not appealed further within 15 days of its receipt, the Griev- ance shall be considered settled on the basis of that decision and shall not be eligible for further appeal.  Arbitration .   Within 15 days following receipt of the Step 2 decision, the Grievant or the Association may appeal the Grievance in writing to 45"},{"page":60,"text":"the Panel Chair for impartial arbitration. The Panel Chair shall set a time, date and place for hearing the appeal. The Panel Chair shall attempt to open the hearing within one-year from the filing of the Grievance (within 5 days of receipt of the notice of appeal if a disci- plinary suspension or a Grievance involving Player safety and health). If the Panel Chair cannot do so given previously scheduled hearings, the Panel Chair shall direct that the Grievance be assigned to an Alter- nate Panel Chair, unless one of the Parties objects. In response to an objection, the Panel Chair shall select Grievance(s) to be assigned to particular Alternate Panel Chair(s) so that hearings for all Grievances will open within one year of filing. A case heard by an Alternate Panel Chair shall be conducted by a tripartite panel if either Party elects in advance of the opening of the hearing. All hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the Rules of Pro- cedure attached hereto as Appendix B. The Arbitration Panel shall ren- der a written decision as soon as practicable following the conclusion of such hearing (within 5 days if disciplinary suspension or a Grievance involving Player safety and health), and may affirm, modify or reverse the decision from which the appeal is taken. The decision of the Arbi- tration Panel shall constitute full, final and complete disposition of the Grievance appealed to it. A decision of an Alternate Panel Chair shall not constitute precedent of the Arbitration Panel, but shall have the same precedential effect as an arbitration decision rendered outside of this collective bargaining relationship. With regard to the arbitration of Grievances, the Arbitration Panel shall have jurisdiction and authority only to determine the existence of or compliance with, or to interpret or apply agreements or provisions of agreements between the Association and the Clubs or any of them, or between individual Players and Clubs. The Arbitration Panel shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to, detract from, or alter in any way the provisions of such agreements. All costs of arbitration, includ- ing the fees and expenses of the impartial arbitrator, shall be borne equally by the Parties, provided that each of the Parties shall bear the cost of its own party arbitrator, witnesses, counsel and the like. 46"},{"page":61,"text":"C.   Special Procedure with Regard to Certain Disciplinary Action  Except as set forth in Article XII(E)(3)(c), complaints involving a fine or suspension imposed upon a Player by the Senior Vice President, On- Field Operations (or comparable title/position) or the Commissioner for conduct on the playing field or in the ballpark shall be subject exclusively to this Section C as follows: (1)   Fines Exceeding $1,000 and Suspensions  (a) The Office of the Commissioner will provide the Players Association with any applicable Umpire’s Incident Report con- temporaneously with the Notice of Discipline. Except as set forth in Section C(2) below (with respect to fines of $1,000 or less and no suspension), any Player who believes that he has a justifiable complaint regarding such discipline may, within 7 days of his receipt of written notification of the discipline, appeal in writing to the Special Assistant to the Commissioner, if the discipline was imposed by the Senior Vice President, On-Field Operations (or comparable title/position), or to the Commissioner, if the disci- pline was imposed by him, for a hearing. (b) Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Special Assistant to the Commissioner or the Commissioner, as the case may be, shall designate a time and place for hearing the appeal, which hearing shall be commenced within 10 days from the date of receipt of the appeal. Unless the appeal involves an incident in which three or more players were suspended, all appeal hearings shall be held by videoconference, except that the Player may elect an in-person hearing in the following circumstances: (i) the Player is available for a hearing in New York during the 10-day period; or (ii) the Player is suspended in excess of five games (for a starting pitcher) or in excess of three games (for a position player or relief pitcher), in which case an in-person hearing shall be scheduled at a mutually agreeable location within the 10-day period. (c)   Discipline   for   Post-season   Conduct.   Notwithstanding paragraph (b) above, a hearing involving a suspension for con- duct on the playing field or in the ballpark during the post-season shall be heard within forty-eight (48) hours of the receipt of the 47"},{"page":62,"text":"appeal. The Senior Vice President, On-Field Operations (or com- parable title/position), or the Commissioner, as the case may be, shall determine the timing of the suspension, subject to the Player’s right to appeal and without prejudice to the Players Association’s position regarding past practice of the timing of such suspensions. (d) Hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the Rules of Procedure attached hereto as Appendix B. The Special Assis- tant to the Commissioner, or the Commissioner, as the case may be, shall render a written decision as soon as practicable follow- ing the conclusion of such hearing, and may affirm, modify, or revoke the disciplinary action originally imposed. The decision by the Special Assistant to the Commissioner, or the Commis- sioner, as the case may be, shall constitute full, final and com- plete disposition of the complaint and shall have the same effect as a Grievance decision of the Arbitration Panel. (2)   Fines of $1,000 or Less and No Suspension.   If the discipline involves a fine in the amount of $1,000 or less and no suspension, a Player may, within 7 days of his receipt of written notification of the discipline, appeal his discipline in writing to the Senior Vice President, On-Field Operations (or comparable title/position). Such appeals shall be conducted through an informal telephone confer- ence at a mutually agreeable time and date. (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section C(1) above, if any such discipline imposed upon a Player by the Senior Vice President, On-Field Operations (or comparable title/position) involves a fine in an amount which exceeds $15,000 or a suspension exceeding 10 games, any complaint relating thereto shall be appealable, from the decision of the Special Assistant to the Commissioner to the Com- missioner for determination in the same manner and with the same effect as provided in paragraph 1(b) of Section A hereof. (4) All settlements of discipline issued to a Player for conduct on the playing field or in the ballpark shall be non-precedential; pro- vided, however, that the Office of the Commissioner may consider a Player’s prior discipline for on-field conduct when determining the appropriate level of discipline for another infraction, irrespec- tive of whether the prior discipline was subject to a settlement agreement. 48"},{"page":63,"text":"D.   Grievances Initiated or Appealed by a Club Step 1 .   Any Club which believes it has a justifiable Grievance shall present a written notice of the Grievance to the Player with a copy to the Association; provided, however, that for a Grievance to be consid- ered beyond Step 1, such written notice shall be presented within (a) 45 days from the date of the occurrence upon which the Grievance is based, or (b) 45 days from the date on which the facts of the matter became known or reasonably should have become known to the Club, whichever is later. Within 10 days following receipt of such written notice, the Player shall advise the Club in writing of his decision and shall furnish a copy to the LRD. If the decision of the Player is not appealed further within 15 days of its receipt, the Grievance shall be considered settled on the basis of that decision and shall not be eligible for further appeal.  Step 2 .   A Grievance, to be considered in Step 2, shall be appealed in writing by the Club or the LRD to the Association within 15 days fol- lowing receipt of the Player’s written decision. Grievances which involve (a) more than one Club, (b) more than one Player, or (c) a Player who is not under contract to a Club which is party to the Griev- ance, may be filed initially in Step 2, provided that written notice of the Grievance shall be presented to the Association within (a) 30 days from the date of the occurrence upon which the Grievance is based, or (b) 30 days from the date on which the facts of the matter became known   or   reasonably   should   have   become   known   to   the   Club, whichever is later.

The procedures to be followed in arbitration and the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Panel shall be as set forth in Section B above. Nothing contained in this Section D shall be deemed to limit or impair the right of any Club to impose discipline upon a Player or Players or to take any other action not inconsistent with the Uniform Player’s Con- tract or any agreement with the Association to which the Club is a Party. Any complaint or dispute which may be a subject for discipline shall not constitute a proper basis for a Club Grievance under this Section D.  E.   Grievances Initiated or Appealed by the Association  (1) The Association may on its own motion appeal Grievances or complaints on behalf of a Player or Players as provided in this Grievance Procedure, except that the Association will not appeal a Grievance or complaint involving player discipline without the approval of the Player or Players concerned. (2) The Association may on its own motion initiate Grievances or complaints on behalf of a Player or Players on all matters not involving player discipline. Nothing herein shall interfere with the right of a Player who initiates a disciplinary Grievance or complaint to be represented by the Association at any Step of the Grievance Procedure.  F.   Miscellaneous  (1) Each of the time limits set forth herein may be extended by mutual agreement of the Parties involved. (2) If any Grievance is not processed in accordance with the pre- scribed time limits in any Step, unless an extension of time has been mutually agreed upon, either party, after notifying the other party of its intent in writing, may appeal to the next Step. (3) Any decision which is appealable under this Grievance Pro- cedure but which is not appealed within the time allowed or within any time mutually agreed upon by the Parties shall constitute a full, final and complete disposition of the Grievance involved. (4)   In any discussion or hearing provided for in the Grievance Procedure, a Player may be accompanied by a representative of the 50"},{"page":65,"text":"Association who may participate in such discussion or hearing and represent the Player.

Survival Following Termination of Basic Agreement  Unless eliminated or modified following an impasse in bargaining, Article XI shall remain in full force and effect after termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that disputes arising after the termina- tion of this Agreement related to the legality or validity of unilateral changes of terms and conditions of employment following an impasse in bargaining and any other self-help conduct of the Parties, including but not limited to, unilateral changes in nonmandatory subjects of bar- gaining, shall not be subject to Article XI.  ARTICLE XII—Discipline A.   Just Cause  The Parties recognize that a Player may be subjected to disciplinary action for just cause by his Club, the Senior Vice President, On-Field Operations (or comparable title/position) or the Commissioner. There- fore, in Grievances regarding discipline, the issue to be resolved shall be whether there has been just cause for the penalty imposed. If discipline imposed upon a Player is determined to be improper by reason of a final decision under this Grievance Procedure, the Player shall promptly be made whole. The term “make whole” means: (1) if a fine is found to have been imposed improperly, the fine will be promptly repaid; (2) any salary loss as a result of an improper suspension will be promptly paid; (3) in the application of items (1) and (2) above, interest will also be paid at the rate per annum set forth in Article XV(K) below; and (4) crediting the Player with performance statistics for the pur- pose of determining whether a performance level contained in any special covenant to his Uniform Player’s Contract has been met. 51"},{"page":66,"text":"Such credit shall be determined by multiplying the Player’s relevant average per game statistic while he was on a Club’s Active List for the current championship season by the number of games for which the Arbitration Panel determines the Player was improperly sus- pended and adding that product to the Player’s year-end total. Such credit shall not be awarded to a Player for such time that his suspen- sion covers time the Player is on the Injured List.  B.   Conduct Detrimental or Prejudicial to Baseball  Players may be disciplined for just cause for conduct that is materially detrimental or materially prejudicial to the best interests of Baseball including, but not limited to, engaging in conduct in violation of fed- eral, state or local law. The Commissioner and a Club shall not disci- pline a Player for the same act or conduct under this provision. In cases of this type, a Club may only discipline a Player, or take other adverse action against him, when the Commissioner defers the disciplinary decision to the Club.  C.   Notice  Written notice of discipline of a Player (a fine, or suspension, or both) imposed by the Commissioner of Baseball, the Senior Vice President, On-Field Operations (or comparable title/position), or a Club (except for actions arising from participation in the Winter Leagues) and the reason therefore shall in every case be given to the Player and the Association. With respect to discipline imposed upon a Player by the Senior Vice President, On-Field Operations (or comparable title/position) or the Commissioner, the Commissioner shall immediately give to the Asso- ciation notice by e-mail of fines, suspensions and appeals for hear- ings.  D.   Investigations and Discovery  Upon receiving notice from the Office of the Commissioner that it is conducting an investigation of a Player (or Players) that may result in discipline, the Player and the Association shall provide reasonable cooperation with the investigation, including but not limited to produc- ing documents and information. However, the Player and the Associa- tion reserve all of their rights to assert that any investigatory request 52"},{"page":67,"text":"from the Office of the Commissioner does not require cooperation because the request is unreasonable, irrelevant, overbroad, or ambigu- ous, or the requested information is covered by a recognized privilege. Disputes regarding whether a Player or the Association has provided reasonable cooperation in a particular context shall be resolved by the Arbitration Panel on an expedited basis. The Office of the Commissioner may conduct investigatory interviews of Players. Except where circumstances require expeditious handling, the Player and the Association shall receive reasonable advance notice of any investigatory interview with a Player. Where circumstances requiring expeditious handling are present, the Player and the Associ- ation shall receive as much advance notice as is possible, but in no event shall the Association receive less notice than the Player. All par- ties recognize the right of the Player to be represented at such inter- view by the Association and counsel of his choice. At the conclusion of the Office of the Commissioner’s investigation, but prior to the imposition of any discipline, the Parties shall conduct a pre-discipline conference. The Parties’ discussion at this conference shall be considered confidential and inadmissible in any Grievance challenging the discipline that may be imposed on the Player. At or before this pre-discipline conference, the Office of the Commissioner shall describe the results of its investigation and the evidence support- ing discipline. A Player who is disciplined shall have the right to discover, in timely fashion, all documents and evidence adduced during any investigation of the charges involved, including but not limited to any documents or evidence in the possession of the Office of the Commissioner that tend to negate a Player’s guilt, to mitigate punishment, or to impeach any witness who will appear at any hearing challenging discipline. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section D is not intended to super- sede or alter in any way the Parties’ respective rights and positions with respect to the meaning and application of Article XII(A) and (B) or Panel Decision No. 41 ( Ferguson Jenkins ). 53"},{"page":68,"text":"E.   Compliance  (1) Nothing contained in the Grievance Procedure shall excuse a Player from prompt compliance with any discipline imposed upon him. (2) Club Fines.   A fine imposed by a Club pursuant to Regula- tion 5 of the Uniform Player’s Contract in excess of $10,000 may not be deducted from the Player’s paycheck until such fine is finally upheld in the Grievance Procedure or the time in which to file a Grievance has expired. (3)   Discipline Imposed by the Senior Vice President, On-Field Operations (or comparable title/position) or Commissioner. (a)   A fine imposed by the Senior Vice President, On-Field Operations (or comparable title/position) or the Commissioner in excess of $10,000 may not be deducted from the Player’s pay- check until such fine is finally upheld in the Grievance Procedure or the time in which to file a Grievance has expired. (b) The Player’s employing Club is authorized, at the request of the Senior Vice President, On-Field Operations (or comparable title/position) or the Commissioner in the case of a fine imposed by the Commissioner, to deduct the amount of the fine from the Player’s paycheck and transmit such sum to the Commissioner once the fine may be deducted from the Player’s paycheck. (c) The Senior Vice President, On-Field Operations (or com- parable title/position) may choose to suspend a Player without pay for: (i) intentionally throwing a baseball, equipment or other object at a non-uniformed personnel with the intent of causing bodily harm; (ii) physically assaulting a fan or member of the media; (iii) physically assaulting an umpire in a manner that endangers his health or safety; and (iv) making public statements that question the integrity of the game, the umpires, the Commis- sioner and/or other Commissioner’s Office personnel. Suspen- sions without pay for such conduct shall be appealable through the procedures of Article XI(B) in an expedited manner, and the suspensions shall be stayed pending the completion of those procedures. 54"},{"page":69,"text":"F.   Major League Rule 2  The following time limit provisions set forth in Major League Rule 2 shall be inapplicable in disciplinary matters: (1) the prohibition in Rule 2(c) against reinstatement of a Player on the Restricted and Ineligible Lists in the period August 1 to Octo- ber 31, inclusive; (2) the prohibition in Rule 2(c) against application for reinstate- ment from the Ineligible List until after the lapse of one year from the date of placement on such list; and (3) the requirement of Rule 2(c) that the Player’s Club shall be entitled to 30 days’ written notice prior to his reinstatement from the Ineligible List, if application for such reinstatement is filed after February 1 of any year.  ARTICLE XIII—Safety and Health A.   Safety and Health Advisory Committee  (1)   Safety and Health Advisory Committee  The Parties shall establish and maintain a bipartisan Safety and Health Advisory Committee which shall be comprised of an equal number of members representing the Association and representing the Clubs. The purpose of the Committee shall be (a) to deal with emergency safety and health problems as they arise, and attempt to find solutions, and (b) to engage in review of, planning for and maintenance of safe and healthful working conditions for Players. (2)   Committee Meetings  A meeting of the Safety and Health Advisory Committee may be called by any member thereof who believes that an emergency safety and health problem exists and requires immediate attention, and a meeting shall be held as soon as practicable thereafter. In addi- tion, the Committee shall hold at least one regular meeting annually for purposes of review and planning. 55"},{"page":70,"text":"(3)   Power and Authority of Committee  The Safety and Health Advisory Committee shall make recom- mendations to the Parties as to the solution of problems and the establishment of policies. The Committee shall use its best efforts to persuade the Parties to adopt the Committee’s recommendations. The Committee, however, shall only have advisory authority and it shall not have the power to impose its views or recommendations upon the Parties. (4)   Other Rights and Remedies  The Players Association may file and pursue through arbitration a grievance concerning safety and health. The Parties will attempt to avoid grievances on this subject by making every reasonable effort to utilize the Safety and Health Advisory Committee. However, it is not a necessary prerequisite to utilization of the Grievance Proce- dure that the Safety and Health Advisory Committee procedures be instituted or exhausted. Nothing herein shall diminish or interfere with any other rights and remedies the Players or the Association may pursue under the Grievance Procedure of this Agreement or under the procedures established pursuant to the Occupational Safety and Health Act.

Safety Complaints—Responsibility of the Commissioner  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section A, when a safety complaint is made by the Association to the Office of the Commissioner, the Commissioner shall promptly designate a representative to investigate and to attempt to resolve the problem. The Commissioner shall promptly notify the Association of the results of the investigation and of all attempts to resolve the problem.  C.   Injured List  Application by a Club to the Commissioner to place a Player on the Injured List shall be accompanied by a Standard Form of Diagnosis (see Attachment 5), a copy of which shall be provided to the Player and the Association.

In addition to the Standard Form of Diagnosis, the Office of the Commis- sioner may request that a Club provide additional information in sup- port of an Injured List placement before the application is approved by the Commissioner. The Club shall provide a copy of such additional information to the Association. A Club requesting the placement of a Player on the Injured List for a concussion shall submit, in lieu of a Standard Form of Diagnosis, a Concussion-Specific Diagnostic Form (see Attachment 36), a copy of which shall be provided to the Player and the Association. The Concussion-Specific Diagnostic Form shall be completed by the Club Physician and Certified Athletic Trainer and shall include the specified supporting documentation. The Club Physician also must complete and submit the Concussion-Specific Diagnostic Form for recertifica- tion of a Player on the Injured List for a concussion at the date when he first becomes eligible for reinstatement to active status and then every ten days following the date upon which the Player first became eligible for reinstatement (except for Players placed on the 60-day Injured List for a concussion).

Second Medical Opinion  Within 20 days following the execution of this Agreement, the Clubs shall provide an updated, accepted listing of medical specialists, by specialty and by geographic region, to whom Players may upon their request go for diagnosis and a second medical evaluation of an 57"},{"page":72,"text":"employment-related illness or injury being treated by the Club Physi- cian. At least two board-certified physicians shall be designated for each specialty in each of the geographic regions, and all the physicians on the list shall be board-certified in an appropriate medical specialty. The Commissioner’s Medical Advisory Committee, in consultation with a medical professional designated by the Association, shall review and update the list of specialists on an annual basis. The Asso- ciation shall have 30 days from the date of receiving an updated list within which to recommend additions to or deletions from the list. Prior to undergoing a “second evaluation,” a Player shall inform the Club in writing of his decision to seek a second medical opinion, and the name of the physician who will be performing the diagnosis and medical evaluation. A Player may seek a “second evaluation” from a medical specialist on the accepted listing who is located outside of the geographic region within which the Player’s Club is located, provided that the Player is not absent from the Club for an unreasonable period of time. If a Player uses the services of a medical specialist who is on the accepted listing, the Club shall pay the cost of the “second evaluation,” including transportation and hotel costs. Expenses for “second evaluations” by medical specialists who are not on the accepted listing shall be authorized and paid only by prior writ- ten agreement between the Player and the Club. See Attachment 35.  E.   Certified Athletic Trainers  Each Club shall employ two Certified Athletic Trainers on a full-time basis. Both trainers will travel with the Club on the road; provided, that one trainer may remain in the Club’s home city if necessary for the Club to fulfill its obligations to injured players who do not travel with the Club.

Any treatment a Player receives for a Work- Related Injury by a health care provider who is not affiliated with the Club must be authorized by the Club in advance of the treatment in accordance with Regulation 2 of the UPC. If such treatment involves a surgery or invasive procedure, such author- ization must be in writing.

A Club shall provide such records within 10 days of such request. When a free agent provides a Club with medical records, he must represent on a form provided by the Commissioner’s Office that he is providing a complete copy of the records that were provided to him by the Club. (b) Any Player who is a free agent by operation of the Basic Agreement will receive from the Office of the Commissioner, upon request of the Association, log-in instructions that will per- mit him to access his medical records electronically. The Office of the Commissioner will send the log-in instructions within 10 days of being provided written notice by the Association of the names and addresses of the Players who desire such instructions.

Any and all remaining monies in the Pre-Arbitration   Pool   (after   distributing   bonuses   during   the Awards Phase described in subsection (a) above) will be allo- cated among eligible Players who rank in the top 100 in Wins Above Replacement (as calculated by the Pre-Arbitration Com- mittee pursuant to Section 4 below) (“Joint WAR”) among the universe of all eligible Players that season. In order to determine the amount of the bonus paid to each eligible Player who quali- fies for a bonus in this phase (because his Joint WAR in the recently completed season was among the 100 highest for eligi- ble Players that season), the total amount in the Pre-Arbitration Pool remaining after the distribution of any bonuses during the Awards Phase described in subsection (a) above will be multi- plied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Joint WAR accrued by that eligible Player in the relevant season and the denominator of which is the total Joint WAR accrued by all eli- gible Players who qualify for a bonus in this phase during that season (i.e., the cumulative Joint WAR among top 100 eligible Players).

The Association and the Office of the Commissioner will form a joint committee composed of six mem- bers (three representatives from each party) to monitor and oversee the administration of the Pre-Arbitration Performance Bonus Pro- gram (“Pre-Arbitration Committee”). The duties of the Pre-Arbitra- tion Committee will include (without limitation) monitoring the awards, statistics, and statistical methodologies (e.g., relevant Joint WAR formula) and auditing process that affect or relate to the administration of the Pre-Arbitration Performance Bonus Program.

This cal- culation shall be finalized for each season within five (5) busi- ness days of the announcement of final awards that may give rise to a bonus under the Awards Phase (but in no event later than December 15). (b)   Reports.   The Pre-Arbitration Committee will distribute two preliminary reports during the season to Players, Clubs, and Certified Player Agents that provide the Joint WAR rankings and accumulated Joint WAR for all eligible Players. The first interim report will be distributed in the week preceding the All-Star Game. The second interim report will be distributed between September 1 and September 10. The Pre-Arbitration Committee will distribute a final report (the “Final Report”) to Players, Clubs, and Certified Player Agents that provides the final Joint WAR rankings, accumulated Joint WAR, and resultant bonus amounts for all eligible Players within five (5) business days of the announcement of final awards that may give rise to a bonus under the Awards Phase.

For purposes of this subparagraph, all Players will be deemed to have reported to the Club no later than the day after the Player arrives in the Club’s city (or the city of the Club’s opponent).

When a Club directs a Player to report to the Major Leagues and then returns the Player to the Minor League club without selecting or adding him to the Active Roster, the return must be justified based on a change in the circumstances that led the Club to anticipate the Player’s selection or recall.

For Players who are added to the Active Roster, the in-season supplemental allowances pro- vided for by Article VII(E) (to the extent applicable) shall com- mence on the day that they are added to the Active Roster. A Player who is returned to the Minor Leagues on the day after reporting (pursuant to subparagraph 3(b) above) shall be entitled to the Article VII(B)(1) allowance on the day of his return only if he joins his Minor League club after the start of the Minor League club’s game (or he arrives after 6:00 P.M. if no Minor League game is scheduled). (e) A Player assigned from a Major League Club to a Minor League club may not remain with the Major League Club for more than 24 hours. Nothing contained in this paragraph is intended to affect the 72-hour reporting requirement contained in Regulation 7 of the UPC. (f)   Players who are not on the Club’s Opening Day Major League Active Roster on the day that the championship season commences for any Club may not remain with the Major League Club after the time by which Opening Day rosters must be fixed.

(b)   Mobile Application.   The Association and the Commis- sioner’s Office shall jointly identify and make available to play- ers English- and Spanish-language learning mobile applications to allow players to pursue additional learning on off-days, or dur- ing the off-season, and shall provide a license to use that software to any player who requests one.

Notice of a decision to expand by two Clubs shall promptly be given to the Association and the Association may reopen this Agreement with reference solely to the effect upon the Players of such expansion, upon the giving of 10 days’ written notice.  H.   Future Contraction  The Office of the Commissioner and/or the Clubs shall not undertake any centralized effort to reduce the number of Major League Clubs effective for a season covered by this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing in this Article XV(H) shall preclude the owner or owners of an individual Club from taking action (e.g., bankruptcy) that would result in the elimination of such Club. See Attachment 8.  I.   Sale of Club  In all instances of the sale, trade, exchange or other change or transfer in the ownership of a franchise, all obligations owed to present or for- mer Players arising under a Uniform Player’s Contract shall be the obligation of the new ownership of such franchise.  J.   Default Notice  During the term of this Agreement, the right of a Player to terminate his Uniform Player’s Contract pursuant to the provisions of the first sentence of paragraph 7(a) of such Contract shall be limited to defaults or failures to perform which are material in nature; and any notice of alleged default filed by a Player under paragraph 7(a) of the Uniform 77"},{"page":92,"text":"Player’s Contract must be filed with the Club (with a copy to the LRD) by the Association, in writing, plainly labeled as a default notice.

K.   Interest Rate  A uniform annual interest rate, equal to the total of the prime interest rate in effect at The J.P. Morgan Chase Bank on the immediately pre- ceding November 1, plus 1%, rounded to the nearest full percentage point, shall be applied with respect to the following matters: (1) the calculation of the “discounted present value” referred to in Article VI(B)(2)(a)(ii) above, unless the Club and Player mutually agree otherwise; (2)   the calculation of the “present value” referred to in Article IX(F)(1)(b) above; and (3) the calculation of the interest referred to in Article XII(A)(3) above. See Attachment 3.  L.   Players Association Tickets  (1)   The Association shall have the right to purchase eighteen (18) tickets each for the All-Star Game, the Wild Card Series, the Division Series, the League Championship Series and the World Series, which tickets shall not be used for commercial purposes. Such tickets will be for seats located between first base and home plate or home plate and third base on field level or the first level above field level, except the Clubs will not require the holders of full regular season ticket plans to be relocated. Six (6) of the eight- een tickets made available to the Association for each event shall be “preeminent” seats. A “preeminent” seat is a seat that is located in a location comparable to the seats that Clubs provide the Office of the Commissioner for use as the “Commissioner’s Box.” (2) The Office of the Commissioner will review with the Asso- ciation the seat locations proposed by the Clubs to comply with their 78"},{"page":93,"text":"obligations under Section (1) above as soon as that information is received by the Office of the Commissioner. The Office of the Com- missioner will consider in good faith reasonable requests made by the Association to change the location of its allotted tickets.  M.   Family and Medical Leave Act  The Clubs will comply with the requirements of the Family and Med- ical Leave Act (29 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.) and will allow Players to utilize the Bereavement, Medical Emergency and Paternity leaves provided in Major League Rules 2(c)(2) and (c)(3). Medical Emergency and Pater- nity leaves shall run concurrently with any leave available under the Family and Medical Leave Act.  N.   All-Star Game  (1)   Roster  The roster for each All-Star team shall be 32 players, with 20 position players and 12 pitchers (not including any Legends Selec- tions chosen by the Commissioner pursuant to Section 2(e) below). (2)   Election and Selection Process  (a)   Fan Elections .   Fans shall elect nine (9) starting position players in each League, each of whom must play a minimum of three (3) innings and must get at least one (1) at bat in the All-Star Game. The fan election process shall be as follows: (i) For fan election of starting position players, voting will be bifurcated into two phases: “Phase One” and the “Finals.” (ii)   For Phase One, each Club may nominate one player at each position (excluding pitchers, but including up to three (3) outfielders and a designated hitter) (collectively, “Eligible Posi- tions”) to be included on the ballot. Fans may vote for nominated players up to five (5) times per twenty-four hour period during Phase One. The Commissioner’s Office will announce the top two (2) vote recipients at each Eligible Position (including the top six (6) outfielders), in each League. (iii) The single player in each League who receives the most votes in Phase One (regardless of his position) will be announced as the starter at his Eligible Position for his League’s All-Star 79"},{"page":94,"text":"team, and the Eligible Position for which that player was nomi- nated in his League will be removed from the Finals voting phase described in Section 2(a)(iv) below. To illustrate, if, at the con- clusion of Phase One, an American League shortstop received the most votes among all American League players nominated by their Clubs, that player would be the starting shortstop on the American League All-Star team, and there would be no voting on the American League shortstop position during the Finals. (iv) Except as set forth in Section 2(a)(iii) above, the two (2) players at each Eligible Position (including the top six (6) out- fielders) in each League who received the most votes during Phase One will advance to the Finals. The Finals will occur over a four-day period in late June or early July. Fans may vote one (1) time per twenty-four hour period during the Finals. The player at each Eligible Position in each League who receives the most votes during the Finals (or, for outfielders, the three (3) outfield- ers in each League who receive the most votes during the Finals) will be the starter at that position for his League’s All-Star team. (v)   Voting for the finalists at different Eligible Positions and/or in different Leagues may be staggered throughout the four-day period in the Finals. (vi)   The three (3) players at each Eligible Position in each League who receive the most votes in Phase One shall be entitled to a payment as follows: 1st place ($15,000); 2nd place ($5,000); 3rd place ($2,500). Notwithstanding the previous sentence, for outfielders only, the top three (3) vote recipients in each League will each receive $15,000; there will be no payments to any of the other six (6) outfield finalists in each League. (vii) The Parties shall meet and confer each year following the All-Star Game to discuss whether to make any changes to the fan election process for the following year and shall use best efforts to finalize any changes by April 1 prior to the All-Star Game. (b) Player Selections. Players on the Active Rosters of the Clubs and the Injured Lists, as well as managers and coaches, shall elect the next nine (9) position players, including a designated hitter, as well as five (5) starting pitchers and three (3) relief pitchers in each League, in balloting to be conducted by the Office of the Commis- sioner and Association officials. The voting shall take place by 80"},{"page":95,"text":"League only. The balloting shall afford all voters with the opportu- nity to designate five (5) starting pitchers, three (3) relief pitchers and two (2) players at each non-pitching position, a first choice and a second choice. Voters are permitted to vote for Players on their own team. (c) Additional Players.   Promptly following the conclusion of the balloting, the Commissioner’s Office shall select from each League four (4) pitchers and one (1) position player (the “addi- tional players”). Final authority for the selection of additional players shall reside with the Commissioner’s Office (d) Final Player. The last position player on each team will be selected by the Commissioner’s Office. (e) Legends Selection. In addition to the 32 players elected and selected to the All-Star Game pursuant to the procedures set forth above, the Commissioner may choose to add one (1) player (or more than one (1) player if special circumstances warrant) to each League’s roster, in recognition of the player’s career achievements. (f) Mandatory Participation (i)   Each player elected or selected to the All-Star team is required to attend the All-Star Game as an eligible participant on the roster and stay for the duration of the game unless: (A) he is on the Injured List on the Sunday immediately preceding the All- Star Game; (B) he does not play in his Club’s final two (2) games immediately preceding the All-Star Game due to injury; (C) he is a starting pitcher who misses his last scheduled start immediately preceding the All-Star Game due to injury; (D) he suffers an injury in either of the two (2) games immediately prior to the All- Star Game and submits (to both the Office of the Commissioner and the Players Association) a certification from his Club physi- cian, with supporting medical records, documenting the injury and certifying that he is unable to participate in baseball activi- ties, and the Office of the Commissioner approves the certifica- tion; (E) his Club advises him to refrain from baseball activities during the All-Star Break to treat a chronic injury or condition and submits (to both the Office of the Commissioner and the Players Association) a certification from his Club physician, with supporting medical records, documenting the injury and endors- ing the Club’s recommendation, and the Office of the Commis- 81"},{"page":96,"text":"sioner approves the Club’s recommendation; (F) he is unable to render services on the day of the All-Star Game for reasons that would justify his placement on the Major League Bereavement/ Family Medical Emergency List or the Major League Paternity List; or (G) he is ineligible to participate in the All-Star Game under the Major League Rules, including, but not limited to, his placement on the Restricted List. (ii) Any player elected or selected to the All-Star team who is not excused from participation by the Office of the Commis- sioner must participate in all activities required of All-Stars as defined by past practice (e.g., All-Star Game media day). In addi- tion, players who participate in the All-Star Game must remain in uniform and in the dugout or bullpen until the conclusion of the game, unless permission is received in advance by the Commis- sioner’s Office to release the player early. (g) Substitutions.   In the event a player who is a player selection does not participate in the All-Star Game pursuant to Section 2(f) above, the priority of substitution shall be the player balloting, except that the Commissioner’s Office will make the selection if: the top five (5) starting pitchers in the player balloting, the top three (3) relief pitchers in the player balloting or the top three (3) position players at the position in the player balloting, whichever is applica- ble, already have been named to the team or are unable to participate in the game. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the substi- tution rules, in no event shall a player be named as a replacement in the All-Star Game if, at the time he would be selected as a replace- ment, he is unable to play in the All-Star Game. (h) All Clubs shall be entitled to be represented in the All-Star Game. In the event the fan and player balloting does not produce such representation, the required representation shall come exclu- sively from the additional players. See Section 2(c) above. (i) In online fan balloting conducted by MLB.com, fans shall be afforded the opportunity to participate in the naming of the All-Star Game Most Valuable Players (“MVP”). The player selected by the fans shall receive votes not to exceed one-fourth of the number of sportswriters casting votes for MVP. 82"},{"page":97,"text":"(3)   Emergency Replacements  In the event that either All-Star team uses its last catcher, and that catcher leaves the game due to injury, that team may substitute a catcher who has previously appeared in the game. In addition, prior to the All-Star Game, each manager will notify the umpire crew chief of one player selected pursuant to Section 2(c) above who has been designated as eligible to return to the game in the event that the last position player at any position is injured and must leave the game. (4)   All-Star Game Tiebreaker.   In the event the All-Star Game is tied at the end of nine (9) innings, the game will be decided by a Home Run Derby between the teams (the “All-Star Tiebreaker” or “Tiebreaker”), which shall be conducted in the following format: (a) Following announcement of the All-Star Game rosters, the Association, the Office of the Commissioner, and the manager of each League’s All-Star Team shall work together to encourage player participation in the Tiebreaker and solicit player interest in participating. In the event that the Parties have not identified at least three (3) players from each League’s Active Roster who have agreed to participate in the Tiebreaker by the Saturday prior to the All-Star Game, the Association and the Commissioner’s Office shall meet and confer and use best efforts to secure the requisite number of participants. Thereafter, the manager of each League’s All-Star team shall select (i) three (3) players on his team’s Active Roster who have agreed to participate in the All-Star Tiebreaker (“Tiebreaker Selections”), if applicable; (ii) one (1) alternate player from his Active Roster who has agreed to participate in the All-Star Tiebreaker, if necessary due to injury to a Tiebreaker Selection; (iii) an All-Star team coach who will throw batting practice during the All-Star Tiebreaker; and (iv) an All-Star Team bullpen catcher who will catch during the All-Star Tiebreaker. (b)   At the conclusion of the ninth inning of a tied All-Star Game, play shall be briefly paused to allow the grounds crew to reconfigure the field in an arrangement suitable for the Tiebreaker. (c) Each Tiebreaker Selection who participates in the All-Star Tiebreaker shall be given three (3) swings to hit as many home runs as possible. Each player can take an unlimited number of pitches without it counting against their swing total. Players on 83"},{"page":98,"text":"each team may hit in any order during the All-Star Tiebreaker; pro- vided, however, the batters from each team shall alternate. A batter from the visiting team shall hit first and a batter from the home team shall hit last (i.e., sixth). Once all six (6) Tiebreaker Selec- tions have completed their swings, the team with the most home runs shall be declared the winner of the All-Star Game. In the event the teams have the same number of home runs following the Tiebreaker, each manager shall select one Tiebreaker Selection to participate in another round in which the Tiebreaker Selection from each team takes three (3) swings to break the tie. The aforemen- tioned head-to-head format will continue until the tie is broken. The manager is permitted to select a different batter to participate in subsequent head-to-head rounds, so long as the selected batter was one of the original three Tiebreaker Selections (or alternate if necessary due to injury or to protect a Player’s health and safety). (d)   The six (6) Tiebreaker Selections that participate in the All-Star Tiebreaker (if one is necessary) shall each receive $10,000 paid from joint funds. (5)   Participant Benefits  In addition to the All-Star Game and Home Run Derby partici- pant benefits described in Article VII(D), all Players on the Active Roster (i.e., available to play in the All-Star Game) of the winning team shall share equally in a $800,000 bonus (i.e., $25,000 per player). See Article VII(D). (6)   Players Trust Benefits  (a) The Office of the Commissioner shall arrange, as part of the presentation of each year’s Home Run Derby, at least one minute or longer for a Player interview during the actual broadcast of the Derby, the focus of which interview shall be on Trust activities. The Player interviewed will also be offered the opportunity to continue the discussion during a brief period of the competition. Players Association personnel will be available for consultation with the broadcaster prior to the interview. (b) The Office of the Commissioner shall arrange, as part of the presentation of the All-Star Game, a meaningful promotion of the Players Trust during the national broadcast of the All-Star Game 84"},{"page":99,"text":"through the broadcast of a promotional highlight of Players Trust activities. Players Association personnel will be available for con- sultation with the broadcaster prior to the promotion. (7)   Microphones.   Content   from   the   player-worn   microphones contemplated below shall be subject to the terms set forth in Attach- ment 57. (a) A catcher, first baseman, and one or more outfielders play- ing in the All-Star Game will be encouraged by the Players Asso- ciation to wear a one-way microphone on a seven-second delay, provided that staff from the Association shall be exclusively responsible for communications with Players in this regard. The Association will guarantee that a minimum of two Players per All-Star Team will wear a one-way microphone. (b)   In addition, at the request of the Office of the Commis- sioner, a minimum of three (3) players per All-Star team shall wear a two-way microphone for at least one half-inning while the player is at bat or in the field. If for good cause an All-Star team does not produce a minimum of three (3) participants, the com- mitment of six (6) total player-participants regardless of team shall satisfy this provision, provided that the Parties agree to work together and with the broadcaster to ensure the appropriate mix of starters and reserves over the course of the Game.   Each player who wears a two-way microphone in the All-Star Game shall receive a stipend from joint funds. Stipend amounts shall be $10,000 for the 2022 and 2023 All-Star Games, and $15,000 starting with the 2024 All-Star Game.

ARTICLE XVI—Deferred Compensation  There shall be no limitations on either the amount of deferred compen- sation or the percentage of total compensation attributable to deferred compensation for which a Uniform Player’s Contract may provide. Deferred compensation obligations incurred in a Contract executed after December 31, 1985 but before September 30, 2002 must be fully funded by the Club, in an amount equal to the present value of the total deferred compensation obligation, on or before the third January 1 fol- lowing the championship season in which the deferred compensation is earned. Deferred compensation obligations incurred in a Contract executed on or after September 30, 2002 must be fully funded by the Club, in an amount equal to the present value of the total deferred com- pensation obligation, on or before the second July 1 following the championship season in which the deferred compensation is earned. For purposes of this Article XVI, full funding of the present value of deferred compensation obligations shall mean that the Club must have funded, for the duration of and without interruption in each year, the current present value of the then outstanding deferred payments, dis- counted by 5% annually. If the prime interest rate in effect at The J.P. Morgan Chase Bank on the immediately preceding November 1 is 7% or higher, the Parties shall meet and confer regarding this Article XVI discount rate and may, with due notice to the Clubs, amend such dis- count rate effective the next succeeding July 1.

Such deductible amount shall be applied to the aggregate of 89"},{"page":104,"text":"90 Uniform Player’s Contracts executed during a given Basic Agreement period before December 11, 2011, and shall be in an amount equal to the lesser of $2,000,000 or the present value of the total deferred com- pensation obligations owed by a Club pursuant to Uniform Player’s Contracts executed during a given Basic Agreement period before December 11, 2011. The deductible amount applicable to Uniform Player’s Contracts signed during a given Basic Agreement period before December 11, 2011 is applied against the Club’s current aggre- gate   deferred   compensation   funding   obligations   from   Uniform Player’s Contracts signed during that Basic Agreement period and not any particular Uniform Player’s Contract(s). Unless the Uniform Player’s Contract provides otherwise, a Club may fund deferred compensation obligations in such manner as it elects, provided that: (a) the funding method used by the Club must be such that the amount(s) funded are exclusively for the uses and purposes of satisfying the deferred compensation obligation(s) being funded; (b) the amount(s) funded are maintained in the form of unencumbered assets comprising cash or cash equivalents and/or registered and unre- stricted readily marketable securities, unless a Club obtains the Parties’ prior   written   authorization   of   an   alternative   form;   and   (c)   such amount(s) funded are subject to the claims of the Club’s general cred- itors. Each Club shall certify quarterly to the Office of the Commis- sioner by January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31 of each year (and the Office of the Commissioner shall provide such certifications to the Association within 30 days of their receipt) the manner in which its deferred compensation obligations that were required to be funded by the immediately preceding July 1 have been funded. In addition, upon each quarterly certification, each Club shall provide to the Office of the Commissioner all records relating to its deferred compensation funding arrangements, and the Office of the Commissioner shall sup- ply any such records to the Association upon request.

The Committee will discuss and consider any such proposal regarding a Playing Rule(s), and decide (by majority vote) whether to recommend the adoption, revision, or repeal of the applicable Playing Rule(s). Meetings of the Competition Committee shall be convened at such times that will maximize Committee members’ ability to participate (in-person or via videoconference). Support staff from the Office of the Commissioner, and up to two staff members from the Association, shall be permitted to attend Committee meet- ings, but as non-members shall not have a vote on Committee matters. (ii)   Consultation   Period.   The   Competition   Committee shall promptly notify the Office of the Commissioner and the Association of any new or amended Playing Rules recom- mended by the Competition Committee.

The Committee will finalize and announce the implementation or amendment of any Playing Rules prior to the mandatory Spring Training reporting date for the season in which the Playing Rules are going into effect. (2)   Other Playing and Scoring Rule Changes.   If during the term of this Agreement any playing or scoring rule changes are proposed"},{"page":107,"text":"which do not significantly affect Players’ terms and conditions of employment (and therefore are not subject to the Competition Com- mittee process described in Section A(1) above), the Clubs agree that they shall give the Association notice thereof but are not obli- gated to negotiate the proposed change with the Association.

Other Rules  If during the term of this Agreement any Major League Rule, or other rule or regulation not covered by Section A above is proposed to be changed, the Clubs agree that they shall give the Association notice thereof, and shall negotiate the proposed change with the Association, provided that the obligation to negotiate with the Association provided by this Article XVIII shall apply only to (a) a change in a Player ben- efit under an existing rule or regulation and (b) the adoption of a rule or regulation which would change a Player benefit under an existing rule or regulation or impose an obligation upon the Players which had not previously existed. Except as specifically provided in this Article XVIII, the right of the Clubs to make any rule change whatsoever shall not be impaired or limited in any way, provided that the Clubs shall not make any change which is inconsistent with the provisions of any then existing agree- ment between the Clubs and the Association.  ARTICLE XIX—Assignment of Player Contracts A.   Consent to Assignment  (1)   The contract of a Player with ten or more years of Major League service, the last five of which have been with one Club, shall not be assignable to another Major League Club without the Player’s written consent. At his sole election, however, a Player may, at the time he signs a multi-year contract with a Club, waive the right to prevent an assignment of his contract under this Section A(1), provided that the multi-year contract (a) is signed before the Player has attained ten or more years of Major League service, the last five of which have been with one Club, and (b) contains a no trade provision that, at a minimum, limits the Club’s right to assign the Player’s contract, during each of its years, to no more than 93"},{"page":108,"text":"sixteen (16) Clubs designated or subsequently to be designated by the Player. (2) (a) The contract of a Player with five or more years of Major League service, not including service while on the Military List (or seven or more years of Major League service, including service while on the Military List), shall not be assigned otherwise than to another Major League Club, without the Player’s written consent. (b) Not earlier than 4 days prior to the contemplated date of an assignment requiring the Player’s consent under subparagraph (a) above, or 8 days, if the Player has no options remaining or if the assignment is during the period from the close of the championship season to the opening of Spring Training, the Club shall give written notice to the Player, with a copy to the Associ- ation, which shall advise the Player that he may (i) consent to the assignment, (ii) refuse the assignment or (iii) elect to become a free agent. Additionally, the notice shall advise that in the event that the Player consents to the assignment, he may elect free agency between the end of the then current Major League season and the next following October 15, unless he is returned to a Major League roster prior to making such election. The Player shall also be informed in the notice that, within 2 days after the date of the notice, or 3 days, if during the period from the close of the championship season to the opening of Spring Training, he must advise the Club in writing as to his deci- sion to consent to the assignment or to elect to become a free agent. A failure on the part of the Player to respond to the notice shall constitute a refusal of the assignment. No response from the Player shall be considered effective until twenty-four hours from his receipt of the Club’s notice; provided, however, if such elec- tion would result in the forfeiture of termination pay, the election shall not become effective unless and until the Association con- firms the election in writing. (c)   A Player who elects to become a free agent under this paragraph (2), and whose free agency election is confirmed in writing by the Association, shall immediately be eligible to nego- tiate and contract with any Club without any restrictions or qual- ifications and shall not be entitled to receive termination pay. Such a free agent shall receive transportation and travel expenses 94"},{"page":109,"text":"in the same manner as he would if he had been unconditionally released except that he shall be limited to receiving travel expenses to his new club if he reports to it directly, provided such expenses are less than to his home city. (3) Any Player who has a right to refuse the assignment of his contract under paragraph 2(a) above may grant consent to an assignment of his contract in advance of any specific contemplated assignment if such consent (a) is granted not more than ten (10) days prior to the start of the championship season for which the consent is given, (b) is in writing, (c) designates the assignee Club and (d) requires that the assignment take place within 45 days from the start of the championship season or the date on which the con- sent is granted, whichever is later. The Club shall provide a copy of the Player’s consent to the Association contemporaneously upon the Club’s receipt of such consent. Any Player with at least 4 years and 127 days of credited Major League Service may grant consent to an assignment prior to accruing, and to be effective after he accrues, the five years of credited Major League Service necessary to refuse an assignment without his consent, in accordance with paragraph A(3). No Club shall attempt to secure, by any Major League terms included in a Minor League Uniform Player Con- tract, an advance consent to an assignment to a Minor League club, and any consent so secured shall have no force or effect. All effec- tive advance consents shall include the option for the Player to elect free agency. Any such elections made pursuant to the advance consent shall require written confirmation by the Association, as set forth under Article XX(D)(3).  B.   Assignment to Minor League club  When a Player’s contract is assigned from a Major League Club to a Minor League club, the rights and benefits of such Player shall be gov- erned by and the same as Minor League players pursuant to the Minor League Basic Agreement; provided, however, that such a Player shall retain any rights applicable to such a Player under the terms of this Basic Agreement. By way of example, a Player whose contract is assigned to a Minor League club shall retain the right, if any, to become a free agent, or to require the assignment of his contract, which he possessed under his then current Major League contract as provided in Article XX hereof, which right shall not be diminished or interfered 95"},{"page":110,"text":"with as a result of such assignment or the signing by the Player of a Minor League contract, provided that such right shall terminate if and when such Player signs a Minor League contract following the time when his free agency rights arise under Article XX.  C.   Injured List—Assignment to Minor League club  (1) There shall be no assignment of a Player by a Major League Club to a Minor League club while such Player is on a Major League Injured List. Players may not be reinstated from the Injured List for purposes of assignment to a Minor League club until they are ready to play. Players who are injured and not able to play may not be assigned to a Minor League club. However, if a Player who is on optional assignment consistent with this provision is assigned to another Major League Club, he may be optioned immediately by the assignee Club without violating this prohibition, regardless of whether the Player is injured and unable to play at the time of the assignment. Grievances alleging a violation of Article XIX(C)(1) that have the potential to affect a Player’s status under Article VI(E), XX(B) or XX(D) shall be submitted to arbitration prior to Grievances that do not affect the status of Players. (2) Notwithstanding Section C(1) above, a Player who is injured and not able to play may be assigned to a Minor League club: (a) During the period immediately following the close of the championship season and before the filing of Major League Reserve Lists under Major League Rule 1(a), if: (i)   the Player’s Major League Uniform Player’s Contract does not cover the next succeeding season; and (ii)   the Player, if he otherwise would have been eligible for salary arbitration as a “Super Two” Player (see Article VI(E)(1)(b)), may elect free agency under the procedures con- tained in Article XX(D) in lieu of accepting the assignment; provided, however, that a Player who accepts the assignment shall not have a right, by virtue of such acceptance, to elect free agency following the next succeeding championship season. 96"},{"page":111,"text":"(b)   During the period immediately following the filing of Major League Reserve Lists and before the 15th day prior to the start of the next championship season, if: (i)   the Player has less than three years of Major League service; (ii) the contemplated assignment would not be the Player’s second   (or   subsequent)   career   outright   assignment   since March 19, 1990; (iii)   the Player had no Major League service the prior championship season; and (iv)   the Player was not selected by the assignor Major League Club in the immediately preceding Rule 5 Draft. (c)   if the assignment occurs immediately upon the Player’s reinstatement from the Restricted List as a result of the Player’s suspension under Major League Baseball’s Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program or Attachment 52 (the Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Policy), provided that the Player was assignable pursuant to this Section C (i.e., the Player was not injured and unable to play, or was otherwise eli- gible for assignment pursuant subsections (2)(a) or (b) above) at the time the suspension was issued. (3)   Rehabilitation Assignments  (a)   Notwithstanding Section C(1) above, a Player on the Injured List may be assigned to a Minor League club for the pur- pose of rehabilitation with the Player’s written consent, a copy of which shall be forwarded to the Association, and with the approval of the Commissioner. See Attachment 39. (b)   Separate consent shall be required for a rehabilitation assignment for a new injury or a reoccurrence of an injury. In order for a Player’s written consent to be effective, the duration of his rehabilitation assignment must be the product of good faith negotiation between the Player and Club. No consent shall be effective for longer than twenty days (thirty days for pitchers). (c) A Player on the Injured List may be assigned to a Minor League club for up to a maximum of twenty days (thirty days for 97"},{"page":112,"text":"pitchers) for each injury, or reoccurrence of an injury, for the pur- pose of rehabilitation. However, a Player may provide more than one consent for the same injury, or a reoccurrence of an injury, if the total number of days of the rehabilitation assignment for that injury or reoccurrence does not exceed a maximum of twenty days (thirty days for pitchers). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Player rehabbing from UCL reconstruction surgery may consent to up to three consecutive ten-day extensions of his rehabilitation assignment, with the approval of the Commissioner’s Office and the Association. (d) Any service with a Minor League club while on rehabili- tation assignment shall be deemed to be Major League service as defined in Article XXI. A Player so assigned shall continue to receive his Major League salary and the other rights and benefits of such Player shall be in accordance with past practices relating to assignments to Minor League clubs. Such assignment shall not be counted as an optional assignment under Major League Rule 7 or for any other purpose, and waivers shall not be required.  D.   Foreign Assignments  Except for the return of conditional assignments from outside the United States and Canada, the contract of a Player shall not be assigned otherwise than within the United States and Canada, without the Player’s written consent.  E.   Optional Assignments  If a Player is optionally assigned for a total of less than 20 days in one championship season, such optional assignment(s) shall not count as an optional assignment in connection with the limitation upon optional assignments provided for in Major League Rule 7(c). See Article XXI(B). For purposes of counting days on option, the date of the optional assignment shall be counted and the date of recall shall not be counted, provided that the date of the optional assignment shall not be counted if the assignment takes place after the start of a Major League game in which the Player otherwise would have been eligible to play, and the date of recall shall be counted if the recall takes place after the start of any Minor League game in which the Player was eligible to play. 98"},{"page":113,"text":"F.   Waivers  Any assignment of a Player contract must conform to the rules regard- ing waivers contained in Major League Rule 8. In addition, each Friday, not later than 3 P.M.

Notification shall include: (1) the date on which the waiver request was made; (2) the date of expiration of the waiver period; (3) if the waiver period has expired, whether or not claims were filed; (4)   if claims are not filed, the period for which waivers have been granted; and (5)   if claims were filed, whether or not the Club requesting waivers has withdrawn its request. In the event claims were filed and the Club requesting waivers has withdrawn its request, the Office of the Commissioner need not identify the claiming Club or Clubs.  G.   Designated Player  A Player who is in the status of a “designated player” under Major League Rule 2(c) shall, during the period he is in such status, be (1) paid at the rate of his Major League salary and (2) credited with Major League service. A Player who is in the status of a “designated player” under Major League Rule 2(c) shall be unconditionally released or his contract assigned within 7 days after he is placed in the status.

If the Player fails to supply a telephone number or address, the Club may use the most recent address or telephone number the Player has supplied the Club. Upon the expiration of the waiver period, the Club shall either give tele- phone or written notice of termination   to the Player. In addition, the Player may call the Club to determine whether his contract has been claimed.  I.   Forms  In any case in which a Player’s consent must be secured prior to the assignment of his contract (see Article XIX(A)(1), Article XIX(A)(2)(a), Article XIX(A)(3) and Article XIX(C)(3)) or in which a Player may elect free agency in lieu of accepting the outright assignment of his contract (see Article XX(D)(1) and (2)), the form given to the Player must include the Player’s name in typewritten form.  ARTICLE XX—Reserve System A.   Reservation Rights of Clubs  Subject to the rights of Players as set forth in this Agreement, each Club may have title to and reserve up to 40 Player contracts. A Club shall retain title to a contract and reservation rights until one of the fol- lowing occurs: (1) The Player becomes a free agent, as set forth in this Agree- ment; (2) The Player becomes a free agent as a result of (a) termination of the contract by the Club pursuant to para- graph 7(b) thereof, 100"},{"page":115,"text":"(b) termination of the contract by the Player pursuant to para- graph 7(a) thereof, (c) failure by the Office of the Commissioner to convey to the Player, by Central Tender Letter submitted to the Association, the Club’s tender of a new contract within the time period specified in paragraph 10(a) of the contract (see Attachment 9), or (d) failure by the Club to exercise its right to renew the con- tract within the time period specified in paragraph 10(a) thereof; or (3) The contract is assigned outright by the Club.

If the amount of Sign- ing Bonus Pool space that a Club forfeits pursuant to subsection 4(c)(i) above exceeds the Club’s available Signing Bonus Pool space in the next international signing period, the remaining for- 107"},{"page":122,"text":"feited amount shall be deducted from the Club’s Signing Bonus Pool in each subsequent international signing period until the full amount has been deducted. (iv) For purposes of subsection 4(b) above and this subsection 4(c), the Oakland Athletics shall be considered a Revenue Shar- ing Payee and not market disqualified in any Revenue Sharing Year in which the Club is not fully market disqualified pursuant to Article XXIV(A)(12). (5)   Unconditional Release Rights for Article XX(B) Free Agents Who Sign Minor League Contracts  (a)   Uniform Opt-Out Dates.   If a Player who becomes a free agent pursuant to this Article XX(B) signs a Minor League Uniform Player Contract with a Club at least ten days prior to the commence- ment of the next succeeding championship season, the player may require the Club to provide him with his unconditional release on the following dates prior to June 1, and subject to the conditions, set forth below. (i)   Fourth Day Prior to the First Day of the Championship Season. Such a player may request his unconditional release, effective on the fourth day prior to the first day of the championship season, by notifying the Club in writing of such request by no later than 2 P.M. Eastern Time on the sixth day prior to the first day of the championship season (i.e., two days prior to when the uncondi- tional release would be effective). If the player requests his uncon- ditional release pursuant to this subparagraph (a), the Club must either commit in writing (with notice to the LRD, which will in turn inform the Association), by noon Eastern Time on the fourth day prior to the first day of the championship season, to add the Player to its Opening Day 26-man roster or Major League Injured List at the commencement of the championship season; or the player will automatically be granted his unconditional release. (ii) May 1. If the player did not request his unconditional release pursuant to subparagraph (i) above and has not been added to the Club’s 26-man roster or placed on the Major League Injured List in that 108"},{"page":123,"text":"season, the player may request his unconditional release, effec- tive May 1. The player must notify the Club of the request for unconditional release effective May 1 in writing by no later than 2 P.M. Eastern Time on April 27. If the player requests his uncon- ditional release pursuant to this subparagraph (ii), the Club must either add the Player to the Club’s 26-man roster or Major League Injured List by 2 P.M. Eastern Time on May 1; or the player will automatically be granted his unconditional release. (iii) June 1. If the player has not requested his unconditional release pur- suant to subparagraphs (i) or (ii) and has not been added to the Club’s 26-man roster or placed on the Major League Injured List in that season, the player may request his unconditional release, effective June 1. The player must notify the Club of the request for unconditional release effective June 1 in writing by no later than 2 P.M. Eastern Time on May 28. If the player requests his unconditional release pursuant to this subparagraph (iii), the Club must either add the Player to the Club’s 26-man roster or Major League Injured List by 2 P.M. Eastern Time on June 1; or the player will automatically be granted his unconditional release. (b) A Club and Player may not agree to a special covenant to a Minor League Uniform Player Contract for a Player covered by this subsection B(5) that provides the Player with additional dates by which the Player may require the Club to provide him with his unconditional release. Nothing contained herein is intended to mod- ify any other provision contained under this Agreement or the Major League Rules with respect to permissible special covenants in a Minor League Uniform Player Contract. (c) For the avoidance of doubt, this subsection B(5) shall apply to Players who became free agents pursuant to the provisions set forth subsections (B)(1) and (2) above, and shall not apply to Players who became free agents pursuant to any other provision of the Basic Agreement or a special covenant to a Major League Uniform Player’s Contract. (6)   Miscellaneous  (a) Any Club signing a contract with a Player under this Article XX(B) after the expiration of the Quiet Period described in subsec- 109"},{"page":124,"text":"tion 2(b) above may not assign his contract until after the next June 15. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, such contract may be assigned for other Player contracts and/or cash consideration of $50,000 or less prior to the next June 16 if the Player gives written consent to such transaction. (b) There shall be no restriction or interference with the right of a free agent to negotiate or contract with any baseball club outside the structure of organized baseball, nor shall there be any compen- sation paid for the loss of a free agent except as provided for in this Article XX(B). (c) A Club and Player (or their designated representatives) shall not enter into any agreement, understanding or contract, or make any representation, promise or commitment, whether implied or explicit, either orally or in writing, that the Club will not make a Qualifying Offer to a Player, or that a Player will not accept a Qual- ifying Offer if one is tendered to him. Any Club or Club employee that violates this provision will be subject to discipline by the Com- missioner, including the potential forfeiture of draft selections. (d) The exercise dates of option provisions contained in Uniform Player’s Contracts all must fall within the Quiet Period described in subparagraph (2)(b) above.  C.   [Reserved] D.   Outright Assignment to Minor League Club  (1)   Election of Free Agency—3-Year Player  Any Player who has at least 3 years of Major League service, or who qualified as a “Super Two” Player under Article VI(E)(1)(b) as of the conclusion of the prior championship season, and whose con- tract is assigned outright to a Minor League club may elect, in lieu of accepting such assignment, to become a free agent. In the event that such a Player with at least 3 years of Major League service does not elect free agency in lieu of accepting such assignment, he may elect free agency during the period between (i) the end of the then current Major League season and (ii) the next following October 15, or 8:00 P.M. Eastern Time on the second day after the date the Player’s   Club   plays   in   its   final   post-season   game   that   season 110"},{"page":125,"text":"(whichever occurs later) (the “Election Period”), unless such Player is returned to a Major League roster prior to making such election. Any Player who accepts an outright assignment as a “Super Two” Player will not retain a right to elect free agency following the season. (2)   Election of Free Agency—Second Outright Assignment  Any Player whose contract is assigned outright to a Minor League club for the second time or any subsequent time in his career may elect, in lieu of accepting such assignment, to become a free agent. In the event that such Player does not elect free agency in lieu of accepting such assignment, he may elect free agency during the Election Period, unless such Player is returned to a Major League roster prior to making such election. (3)   Effect of Free Agency Election  A Player who becomes a free agent under this Article XX(D) shall immediately be eligible to negotiate and contract with any Club without any restrictions or qualifications, and shall not be entitled to receive termination pay; provided, however, if such elec- tion would result in the forfeiture of termination pay, the election shall not become effective unless and until the Association confirms the election in writing. Such a free agent shall receive transportation and travel expenses in the same manner as he would if he had been unconditionally released except he shall be limited to receiving travel expenses to his new club if he reports to it directly, provided such expenses are less than to his home city. (4)   Procedure  Not earlier than 4 days prior to the contemplated date of an out- right assignment, or 8 days, if the Player has no options remaining or if the assignment is during the period from the close of the championship season to the opening of Spring Training, the Club shall give written notice to the Player, with a copy to the Associa- tion, which shall advise the Player that he may either (a) accept the assignment or (b) elect to become a free agent, and that in the event he accepts the assignment, he may (except in the case of a “Super Two” Player who accepts a first outright assignment) elect free agency during the Election Period, unless he is returned to a Major League roster prior to making such election. The Player shall also 111"},{"page":126,"text":"be informed in the notice that, within 2 days after the date of the notice, or 3 days, if during the period from the close of the championship season to the opening of Spring Training, he must advise the Club in writing as to his decision whether to accept the assignment. No such decision from a Player shall be considered effective until twenty-four hours from his receipt of the Club’s notice. If the Club fails to give written notice, as set forth herein, to the Player prior to the date of such assignment, the Player may, at any time, elect to become a free agent pursuant to this Article XX(D); provided, however, that if the Club subsequently gives such written notice to the Player, he shall, within 3 days thereafter, or 10 days, if during the period from the close of the championship season to the opening of Spring Training, advise the Club in writing as to his decision. No such decision from a Player shall be consid- ered effective until twenty-four hours from his receipt of the Club’s notice.  E.   Individual Nature of Rights  (1)   The utilization or non-utilization of rights under Article XIX(A)(2) and Article XX is an individual matter to be determined solely by each Player and each Club for his or its own benefit. Play- ers shall not act in concert with other Players and Clubs shall not act in concert with other Clubs. (2) Upon any finding of a violation of Section E(1) of this Article XX by two (2) or more Clubs, any injured Player (or Players) shall be entitled to recover in monetary damages three (3) times the lost baseball income, he (or they) would have had but for the violation. Such lost baseball income shall be limited to lost salary and other lost contractual terms, including lost additional contract years, lost signing bonuses, lost trade restriction provisions, lost option buyout provisions, and lost incentive bonuses (e.g., performance, awards, attendance and weight bonuses). Damages (and fees and interest) may be recovered only from the Clubs found to have violated Sec- tion E(1) of this Article XX. (3)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Basic Agree- ment, the Arbitration Panel shall further order payment by the Clubs found to have violated Section E(1) of this Article XX of all reason- 112"},{"page":127,"text":"able attorneys’ fees and expenses, expert witness fees and expenses and prejudgment interest on the single damage calculation of the lost baseball income pursuant to paragraph (2). (4) Any injured Player (or Players or the Association) shall not be entitled to recover any monetary damages pursuant to this Article XX(E) other than those enumerated in paragraphs (2) and (3). However, nothing in paragraphs (2) and (3) is intended to reflect any agreement between the Parties on mitigation issues. (5)   In addition, upon any finding by the Arbitration Panel of a violation by five (5) Clubs or more of Section E(1) of this Article XX, the Association shall have the right to reopen this Agreement upon sixty (60) days written notice to the LRD. (6) Upon any finding by the Arbitration Panel of a violation of Section E(1) of this Article XX by two (2) or more Clubs, any injured free agent Player will have the right to terminate his existing contract (or reserve status) at his option immediately following the issuance of the finding by the Arbitration Panel. However, no such termination shall take effect during the period beginning on Febru- ary 15 and ending with the conclusion of the World Series. If the finding of the Arbitration Panel is issued at any time on or after Jan- uary 15, but before February 15, the Player shall have the right to terminate his existing contract (or reserve status) at his option either (a) immediately; or (b) within the fifteen (15) day period following the conclusion of the next succeeding World Series. At the time any contract (or reserve status) is terminated pursuant to this paragraph (6), such free agent Player shall immediately have the right to nego- tiate with and enter into a contract with any Club, without any restrictions or qualifications. If the contract (or reserve status) is ter- minated, the free agent Player may choose to reinstate his contract (or reserve status) at any time up until the March 15 succeeding such termination. (7) If a Player does not exercise his right pursuant to paragraph (6) to reinstate his contract (or reserve status), all obligations of the Player and of the Club under said contract (or reserve status) shall cease as of the end of the period in which the Player has the right to reinstate his contract (or reserve status), except the obligation of the Club to pay the Player’s compensation to that date. If at the end of 113"},{"page":128,"text":"the period the Player has not signed a new contract and has not exer- cised his right to reinstate his existing contract (or reserve status), at that point, the Player shall be considered an unrestricted free agent. (8)   Utilization or non-utilization of the procedures set forth in paragraph (6) above shall be without prejudice to any injured free agent Player. However, the experience of each Player who utilizes such procedures shall be considered by the Arbitration Panel in determining such further relief, if any, to which he may be entitled. (9)   It is understood that in the event of a violation of Section E(1) of this Article XX, the Arbitration Panel shall have the author- ity to order such other and further non-monetary (e.g., injunctive) relief as may be necessary to give full force and effect to the pur- poses of and to the rights and benefits afforded to Players under this Article XX.  ARTICLE XXI—Credited Major League Service A.   Definitions  Those Player rights expressly set forth in the Basic Agreement for which a Player’s eligibility is dependent upon credited Major League service will be determined as follows: (1)   One full day of Major League service will be credited for each day of the championship season a Player is on a Major League Club’s Active List. A total of 172 days of Major League credited service will constitute one full year of credited service. A Player may not be credited with more than one year of credited service, 172 days, in one championship season. Major League service will be computed commencing with the date of the first regularly scheduled championship season game, through and including the date of the last regularly scheduled championship season game. This rule shall apply uniformly to all Players and all Clubs notwithstanding differ- ences in a particular Club’s schedule. (2) For purposes of calculating credited service, a Player will be considered to be on a Club’s Active List if: (a) placed on a disciplinary suspension by a Club, the Chief Baseball Officer or the Commissioner, or on the Injured List; or 114"},{"page":129,"text":"(b) called to active military duty for up to two years or if called to emergency duty by the National Guard for a period of up to thirty days.  B.   Optional Assignments  If a Player is optionally assigned for a total of less than 20 days in one championship season, the Player shall be credited with Major League service during the period of such optional assignment(s); provided, however, that a Player shall not be credited with Major League service under this provision if the Player had zero days of Major League serv- ice in the current season prior to the optional assignment and after the optional assignment was unconditionally released or assigned outright and not subsequently added to the Active List for the remainder of the championship season. See Article XIX(E). For purposes of counting days on option, the date of the optional assignment shall be counted and the date of recall shall not be counted, provided that the date of the optional assignment shall not be counted if the assignment takes place after the start of a Major League game in which the Player otherwise would have been eligible to play, and the date of recall shall be counted if the recall takes place after the start of any Minor League game in which the Player was eligible to play. See Attachment 32.  ARTICLE XXII—Management Rights  Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to restrict the rights of the Clubs to manage and direct their operations in any manner whatso- ever except as specifically limited by the terms of this Agreement.  ARTICLE XXIII—Competitive Balance Tax A.

(6)   “Award Bonus” shall mean a payment to a Player condi- tioned upon the Player having achieved a particular status in con- nection with a recognized or agreed-upon award or honor. (7) “Base Salary” shall mean the amount set out in paragraph 2 of a Uniform Player’s Contract for a given championship season or any amount included in a Special Covenant in lieu of inclusion in paragraph 2. (8)   “Guaranteed Year” shall mean any championship season included in a Uniform Player’s Contract for which more than 50% of the Player’s Base Salary is guaranteed by the Contract in the event of termination under paragraph 7(b)(2).

Determination of Competitive Balance Tax  (1)   Calculation of Tax  A Club with an Actual Club Payroll that exceeds the Base Tax Threshold applicable in that Contract Year (“Tax Threshold” or “Base Tax Threshold”) shall be assessed a Competitive Balance Tax on the difference between its final Actual Club Payroll and the Base Tax Threshold. In addition, a Club with an Actual Club Payroll that exceeds one or more of the three Surcharge Thresholds shall be assessed an additional Competitive Balance Tax as described below. A Club with an Actual Club Payroll at or below the Base Tax Threshold shall incur no Competitive Balance Tax for that Contract Year. 117"},{"page":132,"text":"(2)   Base Tax Thresholds  The Base Tax Threshold shall be $230 million in the 2022 Con- tract Year, $233 million in the 2023 Contract Year, $237 million in the 2024 Contract Year, $241 million in the 2025 Contract Year, and $244 million in the 2026 Contract Year. (3)   Base Tax Rates  The Base Competitive Balance Tax rates are provided below. (a) For a Club that has an Actual Club Payroll above the Base Tax Threshold in any Contract Year, the applicable Competitive Balance Tax rate shall be: (i) 20% if the Club did not exceed the Base Tax Threshold in the preceding Contract Year (“First-Time CBT Payor”); (ii)   30% if the Club exceeded the Base Tax Threshold in the preceding Contract Year, but did not exceed the Base Tax Threshold in the Contract Year two years prior (“Second-Time CBT Payor”); and (iii) 50% if the Club exceeded the Base Tax Threshold in both of the two preceding Contract Years (or in more than two preceding Contract Years) (“Third-Time CBT Payor”). (b) In determining in how many consecutive preceding Con- tract Years a Club’s Actual Club Payroll exceeded the Base Tax Threshold (and, accordingly, whether a Club is a First-, Second-, or Third-Time CBT Payor), instances in which the Club’s Actual Club Payroll exceeded the Base Tax Threshold in any Contract Year   covered   by   the   2017–2021   Basic Agreement   shall   be counted. To illustrate, a Club that had an Actual Club Payroll above the applicable Base Tax Thresholds in both the 2020 and 2021 Contract Years (when, under the terms of the 2017–2021 Basic Agreement, the Tax Thresholds were $208 million and $210 million, respectively), and has an Actual Club Payroll for the 2022 Contract Year that exceeds $230 million (the Base Tax Threshold for the 2022 Contract Year), shall be deemed to have exceeded the Base Tax Thresholds in the two Contract Years prior to the 2022 Contract Year and, therefore, would be considered a Third-Time CBT Payor and charged a Base Tax Rate of 50% in 2022. 118"},{"page":133,"text":"(4)   Surcharge Thresholds, Rates, and Penalties  In addition to the Base Tax Threshold for each Contract Year, there shall be three Surcharge Thresholds. A Club with an Actual Club Payroll that exceeds one or more of the Surcharge Thresholds applicable in that Contract Year shall be assessed an additional Competitive Balance Tax on the amount by which its Actual Club Payroll exceeds the Surcharge Threshold(s), as set forth below. (a)   Surcharge Thresholds  (i)   First   Surcharge   Threshold :   The   First   Surcharge Threshold shall be $250 million in the 2022 Contract Year, $253 million in the 2023 Contract Year, $257 million in the 2024 Contract Year, $261 million in the 2025 Contract Year, and $264 million in the 2026 Contract Year. (ii)   Second Surcharge Threshold:   The Second Surcharge Threshold shall be $270 million in the 2022 Contract Year, $273 million in the 2023 Contract Year, $277 million in the 2024 Contract Year, $281 million in the 2025 Contract Year, and $284 million in the 2026 Contract Year. (iii)   Third   Surcharge   Threshold :   The   Third   Surcharge Threshold shall be $290 million in the 2022 Contract Year, $293 million in the 2023 Contract Year, $297 million in the 2024 Contract Year, $301 million in the 2025 Contract Year, and $304 million in the 2026 Contract Year. (b)   Surcharge Rates  In addition to the Base Tax Rate applicable to the amount by which Actual Club Payroll exceeds the Base Tax Threshold, Clubs with an Actual Club Payroll that exceeds one or more Surcharge Thresholds will pay an additional Competitive Balance Tax on the amount of its Actual Club Payroll over the applicable Surcharge Threshold(s) for that Contract Year. All proceeds generated as a result of these surcharges shall be considered proceeds of the Competitive Balance Tax for purposes of Section B(5) below. (i)   Surcharge   Rate   for   Exceeding   the   First   Surcharge Threshold:   A Club with an Actual Club Payroll that exceeds the First Surcharge Threshold shall pay a 12% surcharge rate, on top of the applicable Base Tax Rate, on the amount of its 119"},{"page":134,"text":"Actual Club Payroll above the First Surcharge Threshold but at or below the Second Surcharge Threshold.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a First-Time CBT Payor Club shall be charged a 42.5% surcharge rate (rather than the 45% surcharge rate applicable to Second- or Third-Time CBT Payor Clubs) on the difference between its Actual Club Payroll and the Second Surcharge Threshold. (iii)   Surcharge Rate for Exceeding the Third Surcharge Threshold: A Club with an Actual Club Payroll that exceeds the Third Surcharge Threshold in any Contract Year shall pay a 60% surcharge rate on top of the applicable Base Tax Rate, on the amount of its Actual Club Payroll above the Third Sur- charge Threshold.

(c)   Rule 4 Draft Selection Penalty for Exceeding Second Surcharge Threshold  Any Club with an Actual Club Payroll at or above the applica- ble Second Surcharge Threshold in that Contract Year shall have its highest available selection in the next Rule 4 Draft moved back ten places in the Draft order. This penalty will apply in each Contract Year in which the Club exceeds the Second Surcharge Threshold, regardless of whether the Club is a First-, Second-, or Third-Time CBT Payor or whether the Club has incurred the same penalty for exceeding the Second Surcharge Threshold in a prior year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Club shall not have its highest available selection moved back in the Draft if that selection is in the top six selections of the first round of the Draft (not   including   supplemental   selections   awarded   pursuant   to Major League Rule 4(c)(2)), but rather shall have its second- highest selection moved back ten places. For purposes of this section, a Club’s highest available selec- tion or second-highest available selection in the next Rule 4 Draft, whichever is applicable, shall be determined after account- ing for any selections received or forfeited pursuant to Article XX(B)(4) or Major League Rules 3(c)(4)(B), 4(c)(2), 4(k), or 4( l ); or selections acquired via assignment. The penalty shall be assessed immediately preceding the Rule 4 Draft. (5)   Collection of Competitive Balance Tax Proceeds  (a)   On the December 2 following each Contract Year, the Commissioner’s Office shall notify the Association and all Clubs of any amounts owed by any Clubs under the Competitive Bal- ance Tax. Clubs shall make Competitive Balance Tax payments to the Commissioner’s Office on or before January 21 of the next calendar year. 121"},{"page":136,"text":"(b) Any Club that does not remit the full amount of the Com- petitive Balance Tax due by that date shall have its next Major League Central Fund (“Central Fund”) distribution and subse- quent distributions, each net of any debt service obligation under the industry credit facility, reduced by up to 50% until such obli- gation is satisfied. For purposes of this subparagraph (b) only, royalty payments from Major League Baseball Properties shall not be considered part of a Club’s Central Fund distribution. Beginning with the day following the payment date specified in subparagraph (a) above, interest shall be charged on any unpaid Competitive Balance Tax amounts at the Imputed Loan Interest Rate for the then current Contract Year. Any interest collected pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be for the benefit of and made available to the Parties’ joint International Tax Fund (or another joint account agreed to by the Parties).  C.   Determination of Actual Club Payroll  (1)   Definition of Actual Club Payroll  “Actual Club Payroll” of a Club in a Contract Year shall be the sum of: (a) a 1/30th share of Player Benefit Costs (and a similar pro rata share if the number of Major League Clubs changes), as determined in Section D below; (b) a 1/30th share of the total amount of the Pre-Arbitration Performance   Bonus   Program   pool   for   that   year   (i.e., $1,666,666.67 per Club in each of the 2022–2026 Contract Years); (c)   the sum of the yearly Salaries (as determined in accor- dance with Section E below and as allocated among Clubs in accordance with this Section C) attributable to that Contract Year of all Players under a Uniform Player’s Contract with the Club for that Contract Year (including optionally assigned contracts); and (d) any other amount includible in or deductible from Actual Club Payroll as a result of the operation of Section C(2)(f) below or as a result of any Club, any Player and/or either of the Parties hereto having engaged in a transaction contrary to Section G(1) 122"},{"page":137,"text":"below or as a result of an award by the Arbitration Panel under Article XI and/or Section F below.

(b) Assignment of Contract (i) General Rule:   If a Uniform Player’s Contract is assigned by any means to another Major League Club, the assignor Club shall be allocated Salary through the date of the assignment and Salary shall begin being allocated to the assignee Club on the fol- lowing day, regardless of the Player’s reporting date. Further, the Salary attributable to the assignor and assignee Clubs will be adjusted as follows: A.   Assignee   Club.   If   the   assignment   occurs   between championship seasons, the Average Annual Value (“AAV”) of the Uniform Player’s Contract will be calculated pursuant to Section E below as if the Uniform Player’s Contract began with the season following the assignment. If the assignment occurs during the championship season, the AAV will be recal- culated pursuant to Section (2)(c) below as if the Uniform Player’s Contract began with the day following the assign- ment. B.   Assignor Club.

Conversely, if the amount allocated to the Actual Club Pay- roll of the assignor Club exceeds the total compensation the assignor Club has paid the Player under the assigned Uniform Player’s Contract (including any Contract(s) superseded by the assigned Contract) (“Net Overcharge”), the difference shall be prorated over each season the Player spent with the assignor Club under that Uniform Player’s Contract (with the current championship season (and any season in which the Player accrued service with multiple Clubs) treated as a fractional year with a numerator equal to the number of days in the championship season that the Player spent with the assignor Club and a denominator equal to the total number of days in the championship season). For any Contract Year in which the assignor Club exceeded the Base Tax (and was assessed a Competitive Balance Tax) pursuant to Section B above, the difference between the amount of tax the Club paid and the amount of tax the Club would have paid had the prorated por- tion of the Net Overcharge been deducted from the Club’s Actual Club Payroll in that Contract Year shall be calculated; and the Club shall then be permitted to defray Competitive Balance Tax obligations by any such aggregate overpayment amount in a future Contract Year. Notwithstanding the forego- ing, if an assignment occurs during the championship season, the portion of the Net Overcharge allocated to the current Con- tract Year shall be deducted from the Club’s Actual Club Pay- roll and there shall be no further adjustment to the Club’s Competitive Balance Tax obligation in that Contract Year. If, in a previous transaction, the assignor Club received cash consideration to defray all or part of the salary obligation of a Uniform Player’s Contract that is subsequently traded again, such cash consideration from the prior transaction shall be deducted from the amount the assignor Club is considered to have paid the Player and from the total considered to have been attributed to the assignor Club’s Actual Club Payroll, subject to the limitation that any negative total shall instead be treated as zero (see subparagraph (2)(b)(iii)(B) below). If the 124"},{"page":139,"text":"assignor Club acquired multiple Uniform Player’s Contracts in such previous transaction, the cash consideration from the prior transaction shall be considered to have been intended to defray the salary obligation of the Uniform Player’s Contract with the greatest total remaining salary obligation, with any remaining   totals   allocated   successively   to   the   Uniform Player’s Contract with the next greatest remaining salary obli- gation. (ii) Bonuses: A.   Performance Bonuses.   Salary arising from Perform- ance Bonuses earned after the assignment shall be allocated between the assignor and assignee Clubs in proportion to the total number of relevant events attained during the Contract Year with each Club. B.   Award Bonuses.   Salary arising from Award Bonuses shall be allocated to the Actual Club Payroll of the Club responsible for paying the bonus under Paragraph 6(e)(4)(iii) of the Uniform Player’s Contract. C.   Assignment Bonuses.   Salary arising from assignment bonuses earned upon or after the assignment and within the Contract Year of the assignment shall be included in the Actual Club Payroll of the Club(s) responsible for paying the bonus in the Contract Year in which the bonus is earned. (iii) Cash Consideration:  General Rule.   An assignor Club that pays cash consideration to defray all or part of the salary obligation of the assignee Club for an assigned Player or Players shall include such cash consid- eration in its Actual Club Payroll on a pro-rata basis over the remaining Guaranteed Years of the assigned Contract(s) (i.e., in proportion to the total Salary assigned in each Contract Year). A.   Any cash consideration that is included in the Actual Club Payroll of the payor Club shall be subtracted from the Actual Club Payroll of the payee Club in the same Contract Year in which it is added to the payor Club’s Actual Club Payroll. B.   Can’t Go Negative Rule.   Notwithstanding the foregoing in Paragraph A above, an assignee Club may not receive an 125"},{"page":140,"text":"aggregate credit against its Actual Club Payroll(s) for cash con- sideration received in an assignment that exceeds the sum of: (a) the total amount of the acquired Player(s) Salaries that are included in the Club’s Actual Club Payroll(s) following the assignment, and (b) any cash consideration paid by the assignee Club to another Club in a subsequent assignment of the acquired Player(s) that is attributable to those Players. C.   Conditional   Cash   Consideration.   Cash   consideration that is conditionally payable based on the outcome of Club or Player Option decision will be included in the pro-rata calcula- tion described in Paragraph A above if the consideration is con- tingent on the decline of a Club Option Year or the exercise of a Player Option Year, but will not be included if contingent on the exercise of a Club Option Year or the decline of a Player Option Year. If any cash consideration not originally included in the pro-rata calculation described above is ultimately paid (or cash consideration originally included is not paid) as a result of the outcome of Club or Player Option decisions, a true-up charge (or credit) will be applied in the Contract Year(s) covered by the Club or Player Options. Cash consideration that is conditionally payable based on the Player’s earning of performance or award bonuses will be included in the Actual Club Payroll of the Club responsible for paying the bonus in the Contract Year in which the bonus is earned. D.   Cash Consideration Not Intended to Offset a Salary Obligation.   An assignor Club that pays cash consideration that is not intended to offset a salary obligation (e.g., cash consider- ation paid to acquire a Player or cash consideration paid in lieu of assigning an unnamed player) shall include such cash con- sideration in its Actual Club Payroll in the Contract Year in which the transaction occurred; provided, however, that if the transaction occurs between the Trade Deadline and the conclu- sion of the Contract Year, such cash consideration shall be allo- cated to the following Contract Year. Cash   consideration   in   transactions   that   do   involve   the assignment of a Uniform Player’s Contract and assignment fees 126"},{"page":141,"text":"associated with waiver claims shall not be included in Actual Club Payroll. E.   Assignment of a Player Without a Confirmed Major League UPC.   When a Player is assigned before his salary for the next season has been determined (e.g., player is under Club reserve but has not yet agreed to terms), the allocation of cash   consideration   between   Contract Years   under   Section (C)(2)(b)(iii) above shall be delayed until the Player’s salary has been determined. (iv) Salary Increase Upon Assignment:   If a Uniform Player’s Contract provides for an increase in Salary upon its assignment to another Major League Club, such increase shall be included in the calculation of the Player’s Salary with the assignee Club pur- suant to Section C(2)(b)(i)(A) above. Any such increase in Salary attributable to the Contract Year during which the assignment occurred shall be treated as an assignment bonus and allocated to the Actual Club Payrolls of the assignor and assignee Clubs pur- suant to Section C(2)(b)(ii)(C) above. Any such increase in Salary attributable to a later Contract Year shall be allocated exclusively to the assignee Club. (c) Contract Signed After Opening Day If a Player first enters into a Uniform Player’s Contract with a Club after Opening Day of the championship season with a Base Salary payable over a full championship season, the Club shall include in Actual Club Payroll such pro rata portion of the Base Salary attributable to that Contract Year as the number of days that the Player was on the Club’s Active List (as defined in Article XXI) bears to the number of days in the championship season. Notwithstanding the above, if such Uniform Player’s Contract covers multiple championship seasons, the Club shall instead include in Actual Club Payroll for the first championship season covered by the Contract the amount calculated pursuant to Section E(2) below. (d) Termination of Contract (i) If a Club terminates a Uniform Player’s Contract that cov- ers a single championship season, the Club shall include in its 127"},{"page":142,"text":"Actual Club Payroll for the Contract Year in which that season falls any Salary paid to that Player, either under this Agreement or a Special Covenant to the Contract (subject to any offset called for by this Agreement or a Special Covenant). (ii) If a Club terminates a multi-year Uniform Player’s Con- tract while it remains obligated to pay Salary under either this Agreement or a Special Covenant to the Contract, Salary shall be allocated to that Club for each Contract Year during which its obligation continues. Salary shall be attributed to each such Con- tract Year pursuant to this Article XXIII (subject to any offset called for by this Agreement or a Special Covenant). This attribu- tion shall apply even if the Club pays the Salary in advance. (e) Split Contracts The earnings of a Player signatory to a Split Contract shall be included in Actual Club Payroll at the total amount of the Player’s actual baseball earnings under that Contract from Major League Clubs (and from Minor League clubs, if any) for that Contract Year. (f) Outright Assignment to a Minor League club  Any Uniform Player’s Contract that is assigned outright to a Minor League club shall be included in the Club’s Actual Club Payroll. (g) Suspensions and Restricted List Placements If a Player does not receive salary due to his placement on the Restricted List or other Inactive List, the Player’s Salary attribut- able to Actual Club Payroll in that Contract Year shall be reduced in proportion to the amount of salary lost by the Player due to his placement on the Restricted List or other Inactive List.  D.   Benefits or Player Benefit Costs  (1)   Definition  The Clubs’ Benefits or Player Benefit Costs (composed of Base Benefits and Extended Benefits) for a particular Contract Year shall include the sums paid (or to be paid on a proper accrual basis for that Contract Year) by or on behalf of the Clubs for, to, or on behalf of present Players (and former Players when expressly noted) for: 128"},{"page":143,"text":"(a)   Club Contributions to the Major League Baseball Players Benefit Plan (“Base Benefits”) Base Benefits shall include contributions to the Major League Baseball Players Benefit Plan, in the full amounts called for by paragraph 5 of the Agreement re Major League Baseball Players Benefit Plan (including contributions made on behalf of former Players and others but excluding contributions made from Com- petitive Balance Tax proceeds). (b) Other Player Benefit Costs (“Extended Benefits”) Extended Benefits shall include: (i) Workers’ compensation premiums, payroll, unemployment compensation and social security taxes (including payments made on behalf of a Player released from a Contract that covers that Contract Year, provided that the Player’s Salary is included in a Club’s final Actual Club Payroll for that Contract Year); (ii)   Spring   Training   allowances   (as   described   in Article VII(C)),   championship   season   meal   and   tip   allowances   (as described in Article VII(B)), meals provided to players during the championship season pursuant to Attachment 47, All-Star Game expenses (as described in Article VII(D)), All-Star Game win- ners’ pool (as described in Article XV(N)), Home Run Derby prize money (as described in Attachment 16), and “in-season sup- plemental allowances” (as described in Article VII(E)); (iii)   moving and traveling expenses (as described in Article VIII), including payments made to former Players in connection with relocations resulting from assignments while they were active Players; (iv)   contributions (in their entirety) to the post-season Play- ers’ pool as described in Article X; (v)   the College Scholarship Plan and Continuing Education Program (including payments made on behalf of former players); (vi) player medical costs (e.g., fees to doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers, and the drugs and other medical sup- plies for the treatment of Player injuries), but not including salaries of trainers or other Club personnel, or the costs of Club 129"},{"page":144,"text":"medical or training equipment, or any costs reimbursed or paid for through workers’ compensation or any other medical insurance; and (vii) Stipends paid to Players for participation in International Play Events pursuant to the Player Per-Event Rate Card in Attach- ment 51. Any amounts paid using Joint Funds shall not be included in the Extended Benefits total. (2)   Allocation of Base and Extended Benefits to Actual Club Payroll  (a) For each Contract Year covered by the Agreement (2022– 2026), the Clubs’ annual costs for Base Benefits (for purposes of subparagraph (1)(a) above) shall be $207,140,000 ($6,904,667 per Club), less any Competitive Balance Tax proceeds from the prior Contract Year that were used to defray Clubs’ funding obli- gations under the Players Benefit Plan pursuant to Section H(1) below (which deduction shall not exceed $3.5 million). (b) For the 2022 Contract Year, the Clubs’ costs for Extended Benefits (i.e., the Club’s costs under subparagraphs (1)(b)(i) through 1(b)(vii) above) shall be $276,861,210 ($9,228,707 per Club). (c) Beginning with the 2023 Contract Year and in each subse- quent Contract Year covered by the Agreement, the Extended Benefits total shall be equal to the Clubs’ total costs (under sub- paragraphs (1)(b)(i) through 1(b)(vii) above) during the prior Contract Year, increased by (i) 4% or (ii) the annual rate of increase over the prior year in the combined “sum of yearly Salaries” (as described in Section C(1)(c) above), whichever rate is higher. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Extended Benefit total shall not fall below $276,861,210 ($9,228,707 per Club) in any Contract Year during the Agreement. (3)   Reporting  On or before January 2, the Office of the Commissioner will pro- vide the Association with a summary of the costs each Club incurred for Extended Benefits in the prior Contract Year. Upon request, the 130"},{"page":145,"text":"Office of the Commissioner will provide the Association with the information the Clubs relied upon to report these costs.  E.   Determination of Salary  The determination of a Player’s Salary for a particular Contract Year for the purposes of interpretation and application of this Article XXIII only shall be in accordance with the following rules. (1)   General Rule  “Salary” shall mean the value of the total compensation (cash or otherwise) paid to a Player pursuant to the terms of a Uniform Player’s Contract, including any guarantee by the Club of payments by third parties, for a particular championship season. Salary shall include, without limitation, the value of non-cash compensation such as the provision of personal translators, personal massage therapists, and airfare and tickets exceeding normal Club allotments. Consistent with the rules set out below, all compensation paid to a Player pur- suant to the terms of a Uniform Player’s Contract shall be attributa- ble to the Contract Year(s) in which the Player is required under the Contract to render services to a Club as a baseball player, regardless of how the compensation is characterized under the Contract. (2)   Average Annual Value of Guaranteed Multi-Year Contracts  A Uniform Player’s Contract with a term of more than one (1) championship season (“Multi-Year Contract”) shall be deemed to have a Salary in each Guaranteed Year equal to the “Average Annual Value” (“AAV”) of the Contract (plus any bonuses subsequently included by operation of Section E(4) below). The AAV shall be cal- culated as follows: the sum of (a) the Base Salary in each Guaran- teed Year plus (b) any portion of a Signing Bonus (or any other payment that this Article deems to be a Signing Bonus) attributed to a Guaranteed Year in accordance with Section E(3) below plus (c) any deferred compensation or annuity compensation costs attributed to a Guaranteed Year in accordance with Section E(6) below shall be divided by the number of Guaranteed Years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Multi-Year Contract is signed after Opening Day of the championship season, the: (i) Base Salary in the first Guaranteed 131"},{"page":146,"text":"Year for purposes of the AAV calculation shall be determined by multiplying that Base Salary by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of championship season days that the Player was paid the Base Salary, and the denominator shall be the number of championship season days in that championship season; and (ii) the first Guaranteed Year shall not be considered a full Guaranteed Year for purposes of the AAV calculation, but shall be considered a partial year equal to the fraction described in subsection (i) above. (3)   Signing Bonuses  Any Signing Bonus in a Uniform Player’s Contract (and any other payment this Article deems to be a Signing Bonus) shall be attributed, pro rata, over the Guaranteed Years of the Contract. If a Contract contains no Guaranteed Years, the Signing Bonus shall be attributed in full to the first year of the Contract. (4)   Performance, Award and Other Bonuses  (a) Any amounts that are actually earned by a Player as Perform- ance Bonuses, Award Bonuses or any other bonuses properly included in a Uniform Player’s Contract shall be included as part of the Player’s Salary in the Contract Year in which the service or per- formance giving rise to the Bonus was provided. Potential bonuses shall not be included in the AAV calculation made pursuant to Sec- tion E(2) above. (b) A Special Covenant in a Uniform Player’s Contract that pro- vides that Player performance or achievement in one year of the Contract will increase the Base Salary in other year(s) of the Con- tract shall not be considered in the determination of Salary until the triggering event occurs (other than, if applicable, as a “potential bonus”), unless it is determined by the Arbitration Panel that the Special Covenant was designed to defeat or circumvent the inten- tion of the Parties as reflected in this Article XXIII. As long as such a finding is not made, the additional Base Salary triggered by the Special Covenant shall count as part of the Player’s Salary in the Contract Year(s) to which it is attributed by the Contract once the triggering event has occurred. Multi-Year Contracts shall not be recalculated   on   an AAV   basis   once   the   triggering   event   has occurred; the additional Base Salary shall be added to the Salary as originally calculated for the Contract Year in question. 132"},{"page":147,"text":"(5)   Option Contracts  (a) Definitions (i) A “Club Option Year” shall mean a championship season covered by a Uniform Player’s Contract in which the amount payable pursuant to paragraph 2 of the Contract becomes due or guaranteed at the election of the Club or by reason of specified performance by a Player. Club Option Years shall not be consid- ered “Guaranteed Years.” In addition, any other championship season included in a Multi-Year Contract that is not a Guaranteed Year shall be treated as a Club Option Year. (ii) A “Player Option Year” shall mean a championship season covered by a Uniform Player’s Contract: (A) in which the amount payable pursuant to paragraph 2 of the Contract becomes due or guaranteed at the election of the Player; or (B) that can be nullified by a Player for a reason other than those set forth in paragraph 7 of the Contract. A Player Option Year shall be considered a “Guaran- teed Year” if, pursuant to the Player’s right to elect or subject to his right to nullify, the terms of that year are guaranteed within the def- inition in Section A(8); provided, however, that a Player Option Year shall not be considered a Guaranteed Year if the payment the Player is to receive if he declines to exercise his option or nullifies the championship season is more than 50% of the Base Salary payable for that championship season. In the event that the Player has the right to exercise or nullify multiple Contract Years at one time (“Player Opt-Out”), the Contract Years following the Player Opt-Out shall be considered Guaranteed Years; provided however, that the Contract Years following the Player Opt-Out shall not be considered Guaranteed Years if the payment the Player is to receive if he opts out of the Contract is more than 50% of the sum of the Base Salaries in the Contract Years following the Player Opt-Out. (iii) A “Dual Option Year” shall mean a championship season covered by a Uniform Player’s Contract in which the amount payable pursuant to paragraph 2 of the Contract becomes due or guaranteed at the election of either the Player or the Club. Salaries under any such Contract shall be calculated as if the Dual Option Year is a Player Option Year. (iv) A “Mutual Option Year” shall mean a championship sea- son covered by a Uniform Player’s Contract in which the amount 133"},{"page":148,"text":"payable pursuant to paragraph 2 of the Contract becomes due or guaranteed only upon the election of both the Player and the Club. Salaries under any such Contract shall be calculated as if the Mutual Option Year is a Club Option Year. (b) Option Buyouts (i) General Rule (A) If a Uniform Player’s Contract contains a Club Option Year or a Player Option Year that is not deemed a Guaranteed Year pursuant to subparagraph (a)(ii) above and the Player is to receive consideration upon the non-exercise of that option or the nullification of a championship season (“Option Buy- out”), then such Option Buyout shall be deemed a Signing Bonus. If a Uniform Player’s Contract contains an Option Buyout for a Club decision not to exercise a Club Option Year and an Option Buyout for a Player decision not to exercise a Player Option Year (or to nullify a championship season) that is deemed a Signing Bonus pursuant to this subparagraph (b)(i), then the higher Option Buyout payment shall be deemed the Signing Bonus. (B)   If a Contract contains an Option Buyout relating to more than one Option Year, then only the Option Buyout that relates to the earliest Option Year in the Contract shall be deemed a Signing Bonus. If, however, the Player ultimately receives an Option Buyout that relates to an Option Year other than the earliest Option Year, that Option Buyout shall be included in Salary in the Contract Year covered by the option that was not exercised. (C) If a Contract contains an earned bonus that increases an Option Buyout, the Bonus shall be included in the Salary attributed to the Contract Year immediately preceding the rel- evant Option Year. (ii) Potential Adjustment to Payroll Notwithstanding subparagraph (b)(i) above, if the Player ultimately does not receive the Option Buyout, then for the Contract Year covered by that option, no portion of the Buyout shall be included in any Club’s final Actual Club Payroll. In 134"},{"page":149,"text":"addition, any Club whose final Actual Club Payroll in a previ- ous Contract Year had included that Buyout (or a portion thereof) will receive a deduction (in the full amount of the Buyout included in previous Contract Years, unless already credited under Section C(2)(b)(i)(B) above) in its final Actual Club Payroll in the Contract Year covered by that option. (c) Club Option Years If a Uniform Player’s Contract covers one or more seasons that are Club Option Years, the Player’s Salary for the championship seasons that are Club Option Years, if exercised, shall be the total of the Base Salary and any bonuses included by operation of Section E(4) above. (d) Player Option Years (i) If a Player fails to exercise or chooses to nullify a Player Option Year that is deemed a Guaranteed Year pursuant to Sec- tion E(5)(a)(ii) above, the difference between the amount paid to the Player under his Contract (including any Option Buyout pay- ment) and the amount that has been attributed to Actual Club Payroll (excluding any amounts attributed pursuant to subpara- graph (ii) below) of the Club under that Contract shall be added to (or subtracted from) Actual Club Payroll in the Contract Year in which the Player Option Year falls. If a Player fails to exercise or chooses to nullify multiple Player Option Years, the differ- ence between the amount paid to the Player and the amount allo- cated to Actual Club Payroll shall be applied pro rata over the Contract Years that were nullified. If a Player exercises or fails to nullify a Player Option Year that was not deemed a Guaranteed Year, the Player’s Salary in the Player Option Year shall be the difference between the Salary provided   in   the   Player   Option Year   (including   any   earned bonuses) and the Option Buyout that had been attributed, in all previous   Contract Years,   to   the   Club   pursuant   to   Section E(5)(b)(i) above. If a Player exercises or fails to nullify multiple Player Option Years that were not deemed Guaranteed Years, the Player’s Salary in the Player Option Years shall be calculated as the AAV of the Player’s salaries in the exercised Option Years less a prorated portion of any Option Buyout that had been attrib- uted to Actual Club Payroll. 135"},{"page":150,"text":"(ii)   If the Base Salary (plus any deferred compensation or annuity costs less any Option Buyout) in a Player Option Year (“Player Option Year Value”) is less than 80% of the Base Salary (plus any attributed Signing Bonus, deferred compensation or annuity costs) in the Guaranteed Year with the smallest such fig- ure before the first such Player Option Year (80% Figure), then, for each such Player Option Year, the difference between the Player Option Year Value and the 80% Figure shall be allocated pro rata across the Guaranteed Years preceding the first such Player Option Year (“Valley Charge”); provided, however, that if the 80% Figure is itself less than 75% of the AAV of the Contract (calculated as if the Player Option Year was not a Guaranteed Year), then the 80% Figure shall instead be 75% of the AAV cal- culation set out immediately above. If a Player Option Year that resulted in a Valley Charge is ulti- mately exercised, the Valley Charge incurred by the Club shall be deducted from the Player Option Salary in the calculation of the AAV of the Player Option Year(s). (6)   Deferred Compensation  (a) Definition “Deferred Compensation” shall mean any Salary payable to a Player pursuant to a Uniform Player’s Contract in a Contract Year after   the   last   championship   season   for   which   the   Contract requires services as a baseball player to be rendered. (b) Attribution (i)   Deferred Compensation shall be included in a Player’s Salary as if paid in the championship season to which it is attrib- uted under a Uniform Player’s Contract. If a Contract does not attribute Deferred Compensation, the Contract shall be treated as if the Deferred Compensation was attributed equally to each of the Guaranteed Years in the Contract. (ii) If the Deferred Compensation is to be paid with interest at an effective rate that is within one and one-half percentage points of the Imputed Loan Interest Rate for the first Contract Year cov- ered by the Contract, then the Deferred Compensation shall be included at its stated value. Otherwise, the Deferred Compensa- tion shall be included at its present value in the season to which 136"},{"page":151,"text":"it is attributed, said present value to be calculated by increasing any such payments by the Contract’s stated interest rate, if any, and then reducing such payments back to their present value by applying as a discount rate the Imputed Loan Interest Rate for the first Contract Year covered by the Contract. If the terms of a Con- tract are confirmed by the Association and the Office of the Com- missioner before the Imputed Loan Interest Rate for the first Contract Year covered by the contract is available, the Imputed Loan Interest Rate shall be the annual “Federal mid-term rate” as defined in section 1274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code for the month preceding the month in which terms are confirmed. If a Uniform Player’s Contract uses the date or year in which a Player retires as a triggering event for the commencement of payment of the Deferred Compensation, it will be assumed for purposes of calculating Salary under this Article only that the Player retires on the day that he reaches age 40 or at the end of the Contract, whichever is later. (c) An “Annuity Compensation Arrangement” is an agreement in a Uniform Player’s Contract whereby the Club promises to purchase an annuity to pay the Player after he is no longer required to render services as a baseball player under such Uniform Player’s Contract. (i)   The portion of the cost of the annuity to be paid by the Club while the Player is required to render services as a baseball player under the Contract shall be included as Salary for the Con- tract Year in which such cost is to be paid. (ii)   The portion of the cost of the annuity instrument to be paid by the Club after the Player is no longer required to render services as a baseball player under such Contract, if any, shall be treated as Deferred Compensation attributable pro rata over the Guaranteed Years of the Contract at its present value as calcu- lated pursuant to paragraph (6)(b) above. Any compensation that the Player is scheduled to receive pursuant to such Annuity Com- pensation Arrangement   shall   not   be   considered   Salary   or Deferred Compensation. (7)   Loans to Players  For purposes of this Article XXIII, the following rules shall apply to any loans made by a Club to or at the direction of a Player. 137"},{"page":152,"text":"(a) If any such loan bears no interest rate or an effective inter- est rate more than one and one-half percentage points below the Imputed   Loan   Interest   Rate,   then   an   amount   of   “Imputed Income” as calculated pursuant to subparagraph (b) below shall be included in the Player’s Salary for each Contract Year that the loan remains unpaid. For any other loan, there shall be no “Imputed   Income”   (as   defined   in   subparagraph   (b)   below) included in the Player’s Salary. (b)   “Imputed Income” for each Contract Year covered by a Uniform Player’s Contract shall be calculated by multiplying the difference between the Imputed Loan Interest Rate and the stated rate, if any, by the outstanding balance of the loan. (c) If a Club has made a loan to a Player and forgives part or all of the loan, the forgiven loan amount shall be counted as Salary in the Contract Year in which the loan is forgiven; provided, how- ever, that if a loan that is made after October 23, 2006 is forgiven in a Contract Year in which there is no Competitive Balance Tax, and if the Club forgiving the loan would have been assessed a Competitive Balance Tax for any Contract Year had the loan, by itself or in combination with other loans, been considered Salary from the outset, then the forgiveness of the loan shall be presumed to be an action designed to defeat or circumvent the Competitive Balance Tax. Unless the Club that forgave such a loan can rebut the foregoing presumption, the Club shall be required to pay into the Central Fund an amount equal to the Competitive Balance Tax(es) that the Club would have paid (based on the Tax Thresh- olds that were in effect when final Actual Club Payrolls were cal- culated for the Contract Year(s) in which a Competitive Balance Tax would have been paid) had the forgiven loan (or portion thereof) originally been considered Salary.  F.   Association’s Rights  (1)   Actual Club Payroll Information  (a) In each Contract Year in which the Competitive Balance Tax is operational, the Office of the Commissioner shall provide the Associ- ation with two “Preliminary Actual Club Payroll Compilations,” the first of which shall be provided within 14 days following Opening 138"},{"page":153,"text":"Day of that championship season and the second of which shall be provided on or before July 14. Each Preliminary Actual Club Payroll Compilation shall consist of a list of each Club’s Actual Club Payroll, broken down by Player, and an estimate of Player Benefit Costs for that Contract Year. In addition to the above, the Association may, from time to time, request the Office of the Commissioner to produce a Pre- liminary Actual Club Payroll Compilation or any portion thereof (including the Office of the Commissioner evaluation of any Uniform Player’s Contract, the terms of which have been confirmed by the Association and the Office of the Commissioner) and the Office of the Commissioner shall provide such information within 14 days of each such request, provided that the Association will not make an unrea- sonable number of requests in any Contract Year. (b) Upon the presentation of any evidence that a Player and a Club are prepared to agree to a Uniform Player’s Contract, either Party to this Agreement (i.e., the Association or Office of the Com- missioner) may initiate a process whereby the Parties prepare and exchange evaluations of that prospective Contract for Competitive Balance Tax purposes. The evaluations shall be exchanged within 48 hours of the initiation of the process by either Party. (c)   The Office of the Commissioner shall provide the Associa- tion with a list of the final Actual Club Payrolls, broken down by Player, and Player Benefit Costs for that Contract Year and the Competitive Balance Tax assessed against each Club (“final Actual Club   Payroll   Compilation”),   if   any,   for   the   just   completed championship season on or before the December 2 following each championship season covered by this Agreement in which the Com- petitive Balance Tax is applicable. (2)   Association’s Rights to Challenge  (a) Information Provided Pursuant to Section F(1)(a) The Association shall have the right to question any calculation included in any information provided pursuant to Section F(1)(a) above and the Office of the Commissioner shall provide an answer to any such question within 10 days. If thereafter the Association disagrees with any calculation, it may file a challenge in the Griev- ance Procedure in Article XI at any time before the next November 139"},{"page":154,"text":"30.

Failure by the Association to challenge any such calculation shall not preclude the Association from challenging that calculation if contained in a final Actual Club Payroll Compilation nor shall such failure be of any relevance in such a challenge. (b) Information Provided Pursuant to Section F(1)(b) The Association shall have the right to question any calculation included in any information exchanged pursuant to Section F(1)(b) above and the Office of the Commissioner shall provide an answer to any such question within 24 hours.

The Commissioner will consider the following factors in determining whether to make a Club a distribution from the Fund: (i) the Club’s non-media Net Local Revenue growth rate compared to other Payee Clubs; (ii) the Club’s success at reducing the total amount of proceeds it receives under the Revenue Sharing Plan through rev- enue growth of non-media Net Local Revenue; (iii) the Club’s total non-media Net Local Revenue compared to its average non-media Net Local Revenue over a five- and ten-year period; (iv) the Club’s total non-media Net Local Revenue in relation to its Market Score; (v) the Club’s total paid attendance in relation to its Market Score; and (vi) the Club’s long- and short-term efforts at growing its non-media Net Local Revenue, including, but not limited to, initiatives to increase attendance and attendance-related revenue; expenditures and investments in marketing, promotion, and fan engagement and net business opportunities; and the competitiveness of the Major League team.

ARTICLE XXIV—The Revenue Sharing Plan A.   Definitions  (1) “Financial Information Questionnaire,” or “FIQ,” shall mean the questionnaire completed by each of the Major League Clubs and submitted, together with audited financial statements, on an annual basis for each revenue sharing year to the Office of the Commis- sioner. From time to time, Clubs are also required by the Office of the Commissioner to supplement the FIQ by submitting additional infor- mation in a “Supplementary Information Questionnaire” (“SIQ”). (2) A “Revenue Sharing Year” shall mean the fiscal year of the championship season that falls in that year (and shall be referred to, for any specific Revenue Sharing Year under this Article, as “2022,” “2023,” “2024,” etc., or the “2022 Revenue Sharing Year,” the “2023 Revenue Sharing Year,” etc.). (3) “Defined Gross Revenue” shall mean the aggregate operat- ing revenues from baseball operations received, or to be received on an accrual basis, as reported by each Club on an annual basis in the Club’s FIQ, but shall not include post-season revenue. “Baseball Operations” shall mean all activities of a Club that generate rev- enue, except those wholly unrelated to the business of Major League Baseball. Baseball Operations shall include (by way of example, but not by way of limitation): (a) an activity that could be conducted by a non-Club entity but which is conducted by a Club because its affiliation or con- nection with Major League Baseball increases the activity’s appeal; and (b) an activity from which revenue or value is received as a result of a decision or agreement to forego what otherwise would be Defined Gross Revenue. (4)   “Central Revenue” shall mean all of the centrally-generated operating revenues of the Major League Clubs that are administered"},{"page":160,"text":"by the Office of the Commissioner or central baseball including, but not limited to, revenues from national and international broadcasting agreements (television, cable, radio and Internet), Major League Base- ball Properties Inc., MLB Advanced Media, L.P., The MLB Network, LLC, the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel, the All-Star Game, and national marketing and licensing. (5)   “Local Revenue” shall mean a Club’s Defined Gross Rev- enue less its share of Central Revenue. (6) “Actual Stadium Expenses” shall mean the “Stadium Opera- tions Expenses” of each Club, as reported on an annual basis in the Club’s FIQ. (7)   “Net Local Revenue” shall mean a Club’s Local Revenue less its Actual Stadium Expenses. (8) “Revenue Sharing Plan” or “Plan” shall mean the local rev- enue sharing agreement set forth in this Article XXIV, including the Commissioner’s Discretionary Fund. (9) The “Net Transfer Value” of the Revenue Sharing Plan for each Revenue Sharing Year shall be the total transfer value that would be generated by a 48% straight pool plan using the Clubs’ Net Local Revenue from the prior year (e.g., for the 2023 Revenue Sharing Year, the Net Transfer Value shall be the total transfer that would be gener- ated by a 48% straight pool plan using the Clubs’ Net Local Revenue from 2022), without accounting for any distributions from the Com- missioner’s Discretionary Fund or adjustments due to the market dis- qualification mechanisms described in Section A(12) below.

As a result, the Club’s Blended Net Local Revenue for the 2022 Rev- enue Sharing Year shall be 50% of its 2021 Net Local Revenue, 25% of its 2019 Net Local Revenue, and 25% of its 2018 Net Local Revenue; and the Club’s Blended Net Local Revenue for the 2023 Revenue Sharing Year shall be 50% of its 2022 Net Local Revenue, 25% of its 2021 Net Local Revenue, and 25% of its 2019 Net Local Revenue. (b)   The Blended Net Local Revenue Pool shall be divided equally among the Clubs, with the difference between each Club’s payment into the Blended Net Local Revenue Pool and its receipt therefrom producing the Club’s net payment or net receipt. Each Club’s net payment or net receipt shall be expressed as a percentage of the total net transfer produced by the Blended Net Local Revenue Pool (“Transfer Percentage”). Clubs’ Trans- fer Percentages will be determined for each Revenue Sharing Year pursuant to the formula in this Section A(10). (c)   For each Revenue Sharing Year, a Club’s Transfer Percent- age as calculated above shall be multiplied by the Net Transfer Value of the Plan for that Revenue Sharing Year as described in Section A(9) above to determine the Club’s payment or receipt for that Year.

In addition, the Commissioner shall not, absent agreement of the Parties, distribute more than $4 million to any individual Club in any Revenue Sharing Year or make more than one distribution to any Club with a Market Score of greater than 100 (unless that Club is partially or fully exempt from market disqualification under Section A(12) below) during the term of the Agreement. (b) Procedures. (i)   Written Requests .   Any Club seeking a distribution from the Commissioner’s Discretionary Fund shall submit a request in writing to the Commissioner. The written request must include, but need not be limited to: (i) the amount requested; (ii) the use(s) to which the Club intends to put the requested distribution; and (iii) an explanation of how, in the Club’s view, the requested distribution should improve the Club’s performance on the field.

(iii)   Timing   of   Distributions .   The   Commissioner   shall attempt to make distributions for a given Revenue Sharing Year no later than December 1. The Commissioner may make distributions that are contingent on a Club’s satisfaction of specified conditions and may carry over funds to the next Revenue Sharing Year if the money is not distributed because the conditions were not fulfilled.

General Principles  (1)   Intent of the Plan  The intent of the Revenue Sharing Plan is to transfer among the Clubs in each Revenue Sharing Year the amount of revenue that would have been transferred in that Year by a 48% straight pool plan, plus such transfers as may result from distributions of the Commissioner’s Discretionary Fund. (2)   Other Sharing  Except as expressly provided for in the Basic Agreement or other agreements between the Parties, nothing in this Article is intended to alter current agreements among the Clubs pertaining to Central Revenue, including but not limited to the Major League Central Fund, the Office of the Commissioner, Major League Baseball Properties, Inc., Major League Baseball Advanced Media, L.P., The MLB Network, LLC, the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel, the All-Star Game, and national marketing and licensing. Notwith- standing the preceding sentence and except as expressly provided for in the Basic Agreement or other agreements between the Parties, the Office of the Commissioner shall take no action regarding the allocation or distribution of Central Revenue that is (i) in response to the operation of the Revenue Sharing Plan or (ii) inconsistent with the manner in which the Commissioner has allocated or distrib- uted Central Revenue in the past. 152"},{"page":167,"text":"(3)   Accounting Rules  In calculating net payments and net receipts, the Administrator, on behalf of the Clubs, shall use the definitions contained in the 2021 FIQ, subject to the provisions of Section C below. The inten- tion is to continue to follow Generally Accepted Accounting Princi- ples (“the GAAP rules”) in the adoption and application of revenue and expense definitions contained in the FIQ and to use GAAP or, in designated situations, federal tax principles, as the “default” stan- dards in the accounting conventions, policies and practices reflected in the FIQ (and in any changes to any of the foregoing). It is acknowledged, however, that specific exceptions to the GAAP rules have been and will be warranted to ensure uniformity, consistency and fair treatment among the Clubs, subject to the provisions of Sec- tion C, below. (4)   Interests of the Association  The Revenue Sharing Plan may have a significant impact on the industry globally as well as on individual Clubs. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge that the Association has a significant interest in any aspect of any of the components of the Revenue Sharing Plan or its operation materially affecting either: (a) the overall industry- wide transfer of revenue among Clubs; or (b) the amounts of pay- ments made by individual Clubs and the amounts of receipts received by individual Clubs. This paragraph shall not be construed to limit the Association’s right to assert that it has other legitimate interests in the operation of the Plan. (5)   Other Undertakings  (a) A principal objective of the Revenue Sharing Plan is to pro- mote the growth of the Game and the industry on an individual Club and on an aggregate basis. Accordingly, each Club shall use its revenue sharing receipts (including any distributions from the Commissioner’s Discretionary Fund) in an effort to improve its performance on the field. The following uses of revenue sharing receipts are not consistent with a Club’s obligation under this paragraph 5(a) to use such receipts in an effort to improve its per- formance on the field: payments to service acquisition debt or any other debt that is unrelated to past or future efforts to improve per- 153"},{"page":168,"text":"formance on the field; payments to individuals other than on-field personnel or personnel related to player development; payments to entities that do not have a direct role in improving on-field per- formance; and distributions to ownership that are not intended to offset tax obligations resulting from Club operations. Consistent with his authority under the Major League Constitution, the Com- missioner may impose penalties on any Club that fails to comply with this subparagraph 5(a). The Commissioner, in addition to other penalties he may impose for violations of any aspect of this subparagraph 5(a), may require a Club to submit a plan for its financial performance and competitive effort for the next two years. Such a plan must include a pro forma financial presentation that specifies its attendance, revenues, payroll, player develop- ment expenditures, non-player costs, and capital spending. The Commissioner, after consultation with the Players Association, may direct the Club to change aspects of its plan, including the level of competitive effort reflected in the plan, or take other actions as he considers appropriate (including escrow of a portion of a Club’s revenue sharing payments). The Association has the burden in any proceeding under the Grievance Procedure of demonstrating that the Club’s use of its rev- enue sharing receipts was in violation of this subparagraph 5(a). In any such Grievance, the Arbitration Panel shall consider, among other things: (i) the Club’s expenditures on scouting, player devel- opment, and player payroll; (ii) the Club’s long-term strategy for improving competitiveness; (iii) the uses that the Club has histori- cally made of revenue sharing receipts; (iv) any material adverse changes in local revenue; and (v) the overall financial position of the Club. Notwithstanding the above, if a Club’s Actual Club Payroll pursuant to Article XXIII(C) is equal to less than 150% of its rev- enue sharing receipts in a given Revenue Sharing Year, the Club shall have the burden of establishing in any Grievance that its use of revenue sharing receipts was consistent with this subparagraph 5(a). (b) Each Revenue Sharing Payee Club, no later than August 15, shall report on the performance-related uses to which it put its rev- enue sharing receipts in the current Revenue Sharing Year. That report shall include, in a single submission: a statement of the Club’s strategy for competitive improvement, aggregate revenues, payroll, non-payroll costs, and operating profits, both planned and 154"},{"page":169,"text":"actual, over the recent past and projected for at least two years; pro- vided that the aforementioned financial data may be generated by the Office of the Commissioner for inclusion in the submission. (c) The Clubs and the Association recognize that the partici- pation of two Clubs is necessary for the production of the on-field competition that the Clubs sell to the public. The net payments and net receipts required by this Article XXIV reflect a continu- ation of the amounts paid directly to the visiting Clubs and are in recognition of the principle that visiting Clubs should share, and in fact traditionally have shared, in the economic benefits jointly generated by the Game at another Club’s home field. (d) None of the Parties hereto shall enter into any agreement, or engage in any transaction or other conduct, designed to defeat or cir- cumvent the intentions of the Parties as reflected in this Article XXIV.  C.   Administration  (1)   Responsibility  The administration of the Revenue Sharing Plan under this Article XXIV shall be the responsibility of the Administrator in consultation with the Association. The Administrator shall be the Commissioner or, if so designated by the Major League Baseball Executive Council, a Committee of Clubs and/or representatives. The Administrator may delegate certain of his duties and responsibilities to his staff and/or a committee of Club representatives and/or expert consultants (e.g., the Revenue Sharing Definitions Committee), provided that the Administrator retains final decision-making authority over all mat- ters within his jurisdiction and subject to the Players Association’s rights (as set forth herein). The Office of the Commissioner shall promptly notify the Association of a change in the Administrator.

Players and Clubs may only include special covenants in UPCs exe- cuted after the date of this Agreement that require a Player to make a contribution to a Club’s charitable foundation or charity if each of the following criteria is met: 1.   The UPC is for a Player who has Major League service at or above the threshold for obtaining arbitration eligibility under Arti- cle VI(E) in the prior season; 2.   The UPC is “guaranteed” and covers more than one season, not including any option years (provided that player option years shall be treated as “guaranteed” years for the purpose of this provision); 3.   The special covenant provides for a maximum annual charitable contribution of 1% of the Player’s annual salary or such other amount up to a maximum aggregate contribution over the term of the contract of 1% of the Player’s total guaranteed salary; 4.   The special covenant provides the Player with the option of fund- ing the contribution to the charitable foundation through a payroll deduction, personal check, or some other mutually acceptable payment method; 5.   The special covenant provides that 50% of the annual Player con- tribution be directed to the Club’s charitable foundation for use at the foundation’s discretion, and that the other 50% be directed to the Club’s charitable foundation for distribution to charities to be"},{"page":214,"text":"200 mutually agreed upon by the Player and the Club, with the under- standing that the majority of the latter contribution will be allo- cated to charities within the metropolitan area of the Club absent an agreement otherwise; 6.   The special covenant, including any obligation on behalf of the Player to make a charitable contribution that has not yet accrued, will have no force and effect if the Player’s UPC is assigned to another Major League Club or if the Player is unconditionally released; and 7.   The charitable contribution special covenant(s) was negotiated on an individual basis and is not part of an across-the-board Club or Commissioner’s Office policy requiring all eligible players to make charitable contributions. A special covenant providing for a charitable contribution may be con- sidered by the Arbitration Panel in any grievance involving a determi- nation of whether a Player has complied with his obligations under paragraph 3(b) of his UPC. A Club will supply to any player who has made, or is scheduled to make, a contractually-required charitable contribution to a Club-spon- sored foundation or charity, an annual accounting of the uses of his contributions and the most recent audit report for the foundation or charity. With respect to any Major League contracts that contain a charitable contribution provision and were signed prior to the effective date of the 2012-2016 Basic Agreement, the terms of the January 15, 2010 settle- ment agreement shall continue to govern.

As illustrated below, the Home Run Derby shall be conducted in a single-elimination tourna- ment in which the loser of each bracket is immediately eliminated from winning the event. Brackets in the first round shall be seeded based on current season home run totals through games taking place six (6) days before the All-Star Break, with ties broken by awarding the higher seed to the batter with more home runs hit since June 15 immediately pre- ceding the event ( i.e. , in a #4 vs #5 matchup, where the batters are tied in total home runs, the batter with more home runs since June 15 would receive the #4 seed and have the option of hitting first or second in that round). Any tie thereafter shall be broken by a coin flip. The player with the higher seed in any given bracket shall have the option of hit- ting first or second in that round."},{"page":230,"text":"216  3.   Scoring/Advancement A.   Home Runs.   Home runs shall be counted toward a batter’s total score, and any swings or hits that result in anything other than a home run shall not be counted.  B.   Advancement/Winning.   The batter with the most home runs in each bracket shall eliminate his opponent and advance to the next round (or win the tournament, if in the third round).  C.   Tie-Breakers.   Ties in any round shall be broken by a straight 60-second swing-off (with no stoppage of time or additional time added). If the batters remain tied after the 60-second swing-off, the batters shall engage in successive three-swing swing-offs until there is a winner.  D.   Second Batter Advancement.   Once the second batter in any bracket hits one more home run than the first batter in that bracket, the second batter shall be declared the winner of that bracket and shall not attempt to hit any additional home runs.  4.   Timers A.   Regulation Periods.   For the first round and the second round, each batter shall have 3:00 minutes to hit as many home runs as possible within that period. For the final round, each batter shall have 2:00 minutes to hit as many home runs as possible within that period. Timers will be placed in appropriate places on and off the field, with certain timers clearly visible to the batter.  B.   Release of Pitch.   The timer will count down beginning with the release of the first pitch.  C.   Ending the Round.   A round will end when the timer strikes zero. A home run shall count provided the pitch was released before the timer strikes zero.  D.   Successive Pitches.   The Lead Official will determine and notify the pitcher when he or she can throw the next pitch to the bat- ter. The Official shall base the determination on, among other things, the location of where a batted ball is hit and whether, in his or her judg- ment, it is clear that the batted ball will or will not result in a home run.  E.   Time Outs.   In all rounds, including the final round, each batter shall have the right to call one “time out” per round; provided"},{"page":231,"text":"217 however, that no “time outs” are permitted in the Bonus Period. A bat- ter shall call a “time out” by raising his hand above his head or verbally requesting a time out from the official. The time out shall commence when the official signals the timer operator to stop the timer, and shall last 45 seconds (the second “time out” in the final round shall last 30 seconds). The official shall direct the batter to enter the batter’s box at the end of the time out, and the timer shall commence when the pitcher releases the next pitch.  F.   Bonus Period.   All batters will be awarded thirty seconds of bonus time following the Regulation Period of each round. A batter will be awarded an additional thirty seconds of bonus time if he hits at least one home run that equals or exceeds 440 feet in the Regulation Period of that round. All distances will be measured using MLBAM’s Statcast system. If Statcast is unable to record the distance of a home run, a batter only will be given credit for the home run for purposes of this bonus provision if there is no doubt that the home run landed at least 440 feet from home plate based on alternative methods of esti- mating the distance. Following the Regulation Period, there shall be a break of up to one minute (depending on the preference of the batter) before the commencement of the Bonus Period. The timer will count down commencing with the release of the first pitch in the Bonus Period.  5.   Pitchers & Officiating A.   Pitchers.   Each participant shall have the right to select his own pitcher.  B.   Official   Scorer.   The   Office   of   the   Commissioner   will select an individual to serve as the Official Scorer of the event. The Official Scorer will make the final determination regarding any issue with respect to scoring, home run distance, timers, and any other issue that arises during the event.  C.   Lead Official.   The Office of the Commissioner will select one individual to serve as the lead official on the field. The Lead Offi- cial will notify the pitcher when he may pitch to the batter, and enforce the appropriate time periods. The Lead Official will communicate with the Official Scorer and timer operators by headset.  6.   Prizes.   On or before July 31 following each Home Run Derby the Office of the Commissioner and/or a Home Run Derby sponsor"},{"page":232,"text":"218 shall provide $2,500,000 in bonuses (less any applicable taxes or with- holdings) to the participants in the following amounts: * Tiebreaker: comparison of each player’s next longest home runs until tie is broken.  7.   Bats.   Players may use bats in colors or with designs not other- wise permitted under Major League Baseball’s Bat Regulations, pro- vided that: A.   the bat meets all other requirements of a bat approved for use in Professional Play (e.g., its dimensions and density are compliant with the Bat Regulations); B.   the bat does not contain any markings that are designed for a commercial purpose, including the promotion of a product or com- pany, other than the name and/or logo of the bat manufacturer in a size that complies with the Bat Regulations; C.   the bat does not contain any messages or images that may offend fans, players or others associated with the event; and D.   participants will bring a sample bat to the meeting that pre- cedes the event. A representative of the Commissioner’s Office respon- sible for bat compliance will attend the meeting together with a representative from the Players Association and check the bats. If any bat is deemed by such representatives to be not in compliance, that par- ticipant will use his All-Star Game bat. Bats approved for use during the Home Run Derby under this provision may not be used during the All-Star Game or any other Major League or Minor League games (exhibition or otherwise).  8.   Microphones.   All participants in the Home Run Derby, and players watching the event on the sidelines, will be encouraged by the Players Association to wear a one-way microphone pursuant to the standards described in Attachment 57. In no event shall less than four (4) participants wear a one-way microphone for the event; provided"},{"page":233,"text":"219 that staff from the Players Association shall be exclusively responsible for communications with Players in this regard.  9.   Commercial Sponsorship Activities.   At least the earlier of (a) promptly following the date such sponsorships are secured or (b) seven days prior to the Home Run Derby, the Parties will discuss any oppor- tunities for participants in the event to engage in sponsorship, endorse- ment or promotional activities in connection with any commercial sponsors of the Home Run Derby. To that end, MLB shall send the Players Association on or before that date, a list of all approved or planned sponsors and proposed promotional activities. If a sponsor wants any player or players to wear or use such sponsor’s product, serv- ice or logo, the Players Association must review and approve same.  10.   Promotional Activities.   The participants in the Home Run Derby, upon request, will engage in two non-sponsored promotional activities for MLB or ESPN solely designed to promote the event. Any requested promotional activities beyond the two commitments refer- enced above shall be completely voluntary for each participant. All promotional activities shall take place at such times and places as will be convenient for the involved participant. The Office of the Commis- sioner will provide the Players Association with written notice at least three days prior to the event of any such promotional activities requested under this paragraph. Failure to comply with the notice requirements hereunder shall result in the related obligations transi- tioning to become entirely voluntary.  11.   Charitable Contributions.   The Office of the Commissioner shall have the right, but not the obligation, to agree with a sponsor to provide a charitable contribution to the participants of the Home Run Derby.  12.   Humidors.   The Commissioner’s Office shall have the right to store balls used in the Home Run Derby in a humidor with relative humidity level set by the Commissioner’s Office prior to and during the Home Run Derby. The Commissioner’s Office shall provide notice to the Players Association concerning whether a humidor will be used and if so, what the temperature and humidity settings will be.  13.

In accordance therewith, all Players are required to be in uniform and to wear only Club-issued apparel, outer- wear, and equipment during games (on the field, in the dugout, and in the bullpen). All Players are required to wear only Club-issued apparel, outerwear, and equipment while on the field during batting practice and while in any in-stadium interview room up to 30 minutes follow- ing games. All Players, including those who are not playing (e.g., on the bench or in the bullpen), are required to wear uniforms, including the uniform top, during games.

With respect to any category of equipment or apparel not covered by the Uniform Regulations, the Players Association and Major League Baseball will explore in good faith the possibility of jointly selling an exclusive or non-exclusive license for that cat- egory of equipment or apparel. If the sale of such a joint license is not feasible and Major League Baseball objects to the display of a logo or marks on a particular product, the Player cannot dis- play the logo or marks until the Parties resolve the issue or, if Major League Baseball files a grievance under Article XI(B) of the Basic Agreement, the completion of an expedited grievance process. In a grievance arbitration over this issue, both Parties reserve all of their arguments under the Basic Agreement, the Major League Rules, the Official Baseball Rules, and the Uni- form Player’s Contract to support their respective positions.

It is encouraged that the manufacturer of the item or equip- ment contributes funds to the designated charity of the theme day. In addition, the Office of the Commissioner shall: make available to Players, if practical, non-logoed items or equipment if the Player wants to participate in the theme day event but does not desire to use a product manufactured by the designated corporate sponsor; and, provide the Players Association with recognition supporting theme day. A player who declines to participate, in whole or in part, in any MLB-designated theme day shall be per- mitted to wear any item or use any equipment he would otherwise use/wear during a non-theme day.  N.   Enforcement  The Senior Vice President, On-Field Operations (or comparable title/ position) shall enforce these Regulations and impose discipline as set forth in Section O below.

In cases involving discipline imposed under Paragraph 1.c above, the Special Assistant to the Commissioner shall attempt to hear the appeal within two weeks of the date on which it was filed.

We, on the other hand, have consistently taken the posi- tion that it is. In furtherance of the negotiations on an overall Basic Agreement, you proposed changes to the debt regulations known as the Debt Service Rule, contingent upon a prior acknowledgment by the Association that the proposal and any discussion that it may generate, including any subsequent counterproposals, are without prejudice to the Clubs’ legal position on bargainability. The Association, by this letter, provides that acknowledgment. It agrees that the proposal and discussions shall not be used as evidence by the Association that the topic of debt regulation is a mandatory sub- ject of bargaining in any subsequent litigation, including any grievance or NLRB proceeding.

First, the Parties agree that the Panel cannot resolve disputes concern- ing the meaning, interpretation or application of the Debt Service Rule without resort to its bargaining history, in this or earlier bargaining rounds, which reflects understandings that significantly inform the meaning of the Rule as intended by the Parties. Second, our negotiations over and agreement to the Debt Service Rule are both subject to the agreement reflected in Attachment 20. More- over, the Parties reserve their legal positions regarding the bargaining status of any action taken by the Commissioner pursuant to Section 6.1 of the Debt Service Rule. Third, it was the Parties’ intention, in agreeing to the Debt Service Rule, to ensure that each individual Club has or would have sufficient resources to support its level of debt or proposed debt, as opposed to an intention to limit or reduce the amount that the Clubs or a particu- lar Club could spend on Player salaries. Fourth, the Parties do not intend for the Debt Service Rule to displace or otherwise limit the authority of the Commissioner to take actions, consistent with actions taken in the past, that are designed to preserve the financial stability of the Clubs.

The Rule.   No Club may maintain more Total Club Debt than can reasonably be supported by its EBITDA. A Club’s Total Club Debt cannot reasonably be supported by its EBITDA if Total Club Debt exceeds the product of that Club’s EBITDA during the most recent year multiplied by the EBITDA Multiplier applicable to that Club.  Section 2.   Definitions.   Subject to the amendment procedures set out in Section 6.1 below, the following definitions shall be uti- lized in the administration of the Debt Service Rule: (a) EBITDA. “EBITDA” means a Club’s earnings for its fiscal year, before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as calculated and reported in accordance with Part I, Schedule I, Section D, Line 45 of the annual Financial Information Questionnaire (“FIQ”), which each Club must submit to the Office of the Commissioner after the close of each fiscal year. For the purposes of this Debt Service   Rule,   each   Club   shall   calculate   its   annual EBITDA net of the Club’s net receipts or net payments under any revenue sharing arrangements then in effect among the Major League Clubs. (b) Total   Club   Debt. “Total   Club   Debt”   means   a Club’s total outstanding debt, calculated as an average over the course of each fiscal year, including, without lim- itation, all long-term and short-term obligations and all indebtedness resulting from: (1) debt incurred pursuant to the Major League Baseball industry credit facility; (2) Club Supported Debt incurred by the Club or any Club related party; provided that with respect to any third-party indebtedness incurred by a Club related party, such indebt- edness shall be deemed to be Club Supported Debt unless the Club delivers all relevant Club related party financial statements and annual budgets to the Office of the Com- missioner and demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Office of the Commissioner, that such indebtedness is"},{"page":258,"text":"242 serviceable or payable, in whole, by non-Club funds (regardless of whether such indebtedness is collateralized by assets of the Club); (3) deferred compensation (other than deferred compensation payable to Major League Players (see clause (9) below)); (4) stadium-related debt incurred for or in connection with ballpark construction or improvements; provided, however, that any debt falling within this clause (4) shall not become part of Total Club Debt until the first full season of the operation of the new or renovated stadium for which such debt was incurred; and (5) any other debt that is properly classified as indebt- edness of the Club under generally accepted accounting principles in place as of the effective date of this Basic Agreement, but excluding: (6) the Excludable Debt; (7) advances taken by a Club against future revenue that it is contractually entitled to receive; (8) any debt issued in connection with the monetization of a long-term Club business contract, the proceeds of which are placed into an escrow account controlled by the Office of the Commis- sioner; and (9) any compensation payable to Major League Players, including deferred compensation or any other commitment under a Uniform Player’s Contract, or any obligation to the Major League Baseball Players Benefit Plan or Industry Growth Fund. “Excludable Debt” shall be the first one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) in outstanding debt from any of the sources described in clauses (1)-(5) above; provided, however, solely for fiscal years 2022 and 2023, the Excludable Debt shall be the first one   hundred   and   twenty-five   million   dollars ($125,000,000)   in   outstanding   debt   from   any   of   the sources described in clauses (1)-(5) above. “Club Sup- ported Debt” means any indebtedness (including any loan, advance or guarantee) that is collateralized by the assets of the Club (including any pledge of a direct or indirect inter- est in the Club) or serviced or payable, in whole or in part, either directly or indirectly, using Club funds; provided that, with respect to any loans or advances from a Club’s owner or any related party that are neither collateralized by the assets of the Club (including any pledge of a direct or indirect interest in the Club) nor serviced, in whole or"},{"page":259,"text":"243 in part, either directly or indirectly, using Club funds, such indebtedness shall be deemed to be Club Supported Debt if the Club has not delivered all relevant related party financial statements and annual budgets to the Office of the Commissioner. (c) EBITDA Multiplier. “EBITDA Multiplier” means the number to be multiplied by the Club’s EBITDA during the most recent year in order to determine the maximum Total Club Debt that reasonably can be supported by that Club’s EBITDA. The EBITDA Multiplier shall be eight (8), except that any Club which incurs (or has incurred within the last ten years) stadium-related debt to finance construction of a new ballpark or the major renovation of its existing ballpark may use an EBITDA Multiplier of twelve (12) for the first ten (10) fiscal years after that ball- park’s opening or reopening. (d) Accounting   Rules. Each   Club’s   reporting   and accounting practices relevant to an evaluation of its compli- ance with the Debt Service Rule shall be subject to the Commissioner’s review and approval. Moreover, in any case involving off-balance-sheet debt, the determination of whether the indebtedness shall be included in Total Club Debt under Section 2(b) above shall be made by an auditor retained by the Office of the Commissioner, applying gen- erally accepted accounting principles on a consolidated basis except as otherwise provided by Section 2(b) above. The Major League Baseball Players Association (“Players Association”) may seek review of the auditor’s determina- tion by the Arbitration Panel (see Article XI), in which case the Panel shall show no deference to the auditor’s determi- nation.   Unless   otherwise   provided   in   this   Rule,   when accounting for and reporting on Total Club Debt and EBITDA for purposes of the Debt Service Rule, the Clubs shall comply with the revenue and expense definitions and the accounting conventions, policies and practices reflected in the then-current version of the FIQ.

By the date each Club must provide its final FIQ and audited financial statements for each fiscal year, each Club shall also sub- mit to the Office of the Commissioner: (a) a written certification from its chief executive offi- cer that either the Club complied with the Debt Service Rule during the fiscal year reported in the accompanying FIQ, or the Club did not comply with the Debt Service Rule during the fiscal year reported in the accompanying FIQ; and (b) a   written   summary   (“Related-Party   Debt   Sum- mary”) from its chief executive officer of all owner or related-party debt that was collateralized by Club assets or was serviced, either directly or indirectly, using Club funds or assets. 3.2 Enforcement by Commissioner. The failure of a Club to comply with the Debt Service Rule in a fiscal year shall subject the Club and/or any owner of the Club to any or all of the remedial measures (“Remedial Measures”) set out in Section 4 below until the Club achieves compliance with the Debt Service Rule. 3.3 Exemption from Compliance. Clubs with Total Club Debt below the level of Excludable Debt are exempt from the compliance process (but still must adhere to the certi- fication requirement of Section 3.1 above and the financial reporting obligations established by the Office of the Commissioner, the latter of which are described in Attach- ment 23)."},{"page":261,"text":"245  Section 4.

Remedial Considerations.

Section 6.   Miscellaneous  6.1 Further   Regulations; Amendments. The   Commis- sioner shall issue further regulations and policies concern- ing the implementation, interpretation, administration and enforcement of this Debt Service Rule as he or she deems appropriate. In addition, the Commissioner may amend or otherwise modify the rules, definitions and policies set out in this Debt Service Rule as he deems appropriate. Prior to taking any action pursuant to this Section 6.1, the Office of the Commissioner shall provide the Players Association with notice of such contemplated action pursuant to Arti- cle XVIII of the Basic Agreement. 6.2 Notice to Third Parties.

Clark Executive Director Major League Baseball Players Association 12 East 49th Street New York, New York 10017 Re:   Joint Treatment Program for Alcohol- and Marijuana-Related Conduct Dear Tony: The purpose of this letter is to confirm that the Parties have agreed to establish a Joint Treatment Program to deal with certain alcohol- and marijuana-related conduct and off-field violent conduct by Major League Players during the term of the 2022–2026 Basic Agreement. Specifically, the Parties have agreed as follows: 1.   The Treatment Board, as defined under Major League Baseball’s Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program, will be responsi- ble for creating and supervising individualized treatment pro- grams for Players with an alcohol use problem, a marijuana use problem, or Players who have engaged in off-field violent con- duct. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such conduct constitutes a “Covered Act” under the Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Policy (see Attachment 52), Player evaluation and treatment shall be pursuant to the terms of that Policy. 2.   Referral to the Treatment Board will be mandatory when: (a)   A Player is arrested or charged by law enforcement authorities with driving while intoxicated, driving under the influence of alcohol and/or marijuana, or any other criminal violation relating to the use of alcohol and/or marijuana. (b)   A Player is arrested or charged by law enforcement authorities with a criminal violation in which the authorities allege that the use of alcohol and/or marijuana may have been a con- tributing factor in the misconduct. (c)   A Player appears intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol and/or marijuana during any of the Club’s games, practices,"},{"page":272,"text":"workouts, meetings or otherwise during the course and within the scope of his employment. (d)   Club medical personnel reasonably suspect that the Player may suffer from an alcohol and/or a marijuana use problem. (e)   A Player is charged by law enforcement authorities with a crime involving the use of physical force or violence, includ- ing but not limited to, resisting arrest, battery, and assault. 3.   Any Player who is referred to the Treatment Board will be evalu- ated by the Medical Representatives of the Treatment Board in the case of an alcohol and/or a marijuana use problem, or by a neutral expert selected by the Medical Representatives of the Treatment Board in the case of off-field violence. The purpose of the initial evaluation is to determine whether the Player could benefit from a Treatment Program, and if so, the type of Treatment Program that would be most effective for the Player involved. 4.   A Player’s participation in any Treatment Program is voluntary. A Player’s failure to participate in any Treatment Program shall not subject the Player to discipline. A Player’s referral to the Treat- ment Board is not intended to supplant any right a Club or the Office of the Commissioner may have under the UPC or Basic Agreement to discipline a Player for his conduct, or any potential defenses of the Player or the Association to such discipline. The Player’s participation in any Treatment Program shall be consid- ered as a mitigating factor in any discipline imposed by either the Club or the Office of the Commissioner. Sincerely, Daniel R.

Ballparks Subject to State or Local Ordinance.   The use of all   tobacco   products—including   smokeless   tobacco,   ciga- rettes, and e-cigarettes (collectively, “Tobacco Products”)—by Players is prohibited in any ballpark where such use is prohib- ited by state or local law or ordinance (“Prohibited Ball- parks”). This prohibition shall apply on-field during games. For purposes of this policy, “on-field” shall include all areas of the ballpark that are visible to fans and/or broadcast cameras (e.g., the playing field, dugout, and bullpen). The Clubs who play in Prohibited Ballparks, as of the date of this agreement, are: Arizona Diamondbacks, Boston Red Sox, Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Los Angeles Dodgers, Milwaukee Brewers, New York Mets, New York Yankees, Oakland Athletics, San Diego Padres, San Francisco   Giants,   Seattle   Mariners,   St.   Louis   Cardinals, Tampa Bay Rays, and Washington Nationals. All Prohibited Ballparks will be required to comply with all signage and notification   requirements   of   the   applicable   state   or   local ordinance.  2.   Ballparks That Become Subject to State or Local Ordi- nance.   If, later, a state or municipality passes a law or ordi- nance banning the use of Tobacco Products in a ballpark that is not listed in Paragraph 1 above, the prohibitions in Para- graph 1 above shall apply in that new ballpark as of the date that new law or ordinance takes effect and that ballpark shall thereafter be considered a Prohibited Ballpark. In such an event, the Office of the Commissioner and the Players Associ- ation shall send a joint memorandum to all Players notifying them of the new restriction.  3.   Players Without Major League Service Prior to 2017.  Any Player who had no credited Major League service at the end of the 2016 season (i.e., a Player who made his Major 257"},{"page":274,"text":"League debut during the 2017 season or later) is prohibited from using Tobacco Products on-field during games in every ballpark. In addition, such Players shall be prohibited from using Tobacco Products (i) during televised interviews, and (ii) during Paragraph 3(b) appearances on behalf of the Club.  4.   Players With Major League Service Prior to 2017.   In addi- tion to the restrictions on the use of Tobacco Products at Pro- hibited Ballparks set forth in Paragraphs 1 and 2 above, any Player who has been credited with at least one day of Major League service as of the end of the 2016 season is prohibited from using smokeless tobacco (i) during televised interviews, and (ii) during Paragraph 3(b) appearances on behalf of the Club.  5.   Requirement to Conceal.   At any time when fans are per- mitted into any ballpark, all Players must conceal Tobacco Products (including tobacco tins and packages) and may not carry Tobacco Products (including tobacco tins or packages) in their uniform or on their body.  6.   Penalties.   The penalties for violating the prohibitions in Paragraphs 1 through 5 above shall be: (a) First Violation—Written warning and referral to the par- ties’ Smokeless Tobacco Cessation Consultant (the “Ces- sation   Consultant”)   to   develop   a   Tobacco   Cessation program (see Section C below). (b) Second and Subsequent Violations—A fine shall be issued for any second or subsequent violation in the amount spec- ified in the applicable state or local law or ordinance. In ballparks where no state or local law or ordinance applies, or where the ordinance does not provide a fine amount, the fine shall be $250 per violation. Promptly following issuance of a third notice of violation to a Player, the Play- ers Association shall contact the Player and the Player’s representative, and the Commissioner’s Office shall con- tact the Player’s Club, to discuss the Player’s alleged vio- lations of Attachment 28, including potential steps that can be taken to facilitate compliance going forward. 258"},{"page":275,"text":"Violations will not carry over from year to year over the course of a Player’s career.

B. EDUCATION  1.   The Parties, in conjunction with the Cessation Consultant, will create joint educational programs and materials for Players regarding the dangers of smokeless tobacco. Written materials will be distributed to all Players during each Spring Training of the Basic Agreement. The Parties also will develop an on- line educational program for Players regarding the dangers of smokeless tobacco and available cessation options. 2.   The Parties, in conjunction with the Cessation Consultant, will create joint educational programs and materials for the public (i.e., public service announcements) regarding the dan- gers of smokeless tobacco. These educational pieces will feature Major League Players and will focus on a youth audi- ence.

Prohibition:   All Covered Individuals are prohibited from pos- sessing deadly weapons while performing any services for MLB Enti- ties, including while traveling on business (e.g., road games). In addition, except as required by local law, MLB Entities shall prohibit the possession or use of deadly weapons in any facility or venue owned, operated, or controlled by them.

The provisions of this letter shall apply only to pitchers who start a game on the Sunday immediately preceding the All-Star Game. 1.   A starting pitcher who has a bona fide concern relating to his short-term or long-term fitness to play, may request either directly or through his Club any usage restriction that is reasonably necessary to accommodate such concerns (a “Usage Accommodation”). Potential Usage Accommodations include, without limitation, an inning(s) limit, a limit on the number of batters faced, a pitch limit, availability for extra innings only, or no use at all. All requests for a Usage Accom- modation—including, but not limited to, a request by a Sunday Pitcher to be held from the game entirely—must be submitted in writing to the Office of the Commissioner within 48 hours from the time the pitcher is named to the All-Star Game roster. 2.   If a starting pitcher who properly submitted a request for a Usage Accommodation becomes a Sunday Pitcher, the Office of the Commissioner will consider the following (without limitation) in determining whether to grant or deny the request: a.   Time spent on the Injured List in the current season or prior season, if any; b.   Any work-related surgery performed in the previous eighteen months, including but not limited to an ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction; 262"},{"page":279,"text":"c.

If a Usage Accommodation is granted by the Office of the Commissioner to a Sunday Pitcher, the specifics of the accommodation will be discussed and agreed upon by the Player in question, his Club and the Field Manager of the All-Star team in question, with any dis- putes resolved by the Office of the Commissioner after it consults with the Players Association. If a Sunday Pitcher obtains a Usage Accom- modation directing that he be held from the game entirely, he will be replaced on the roster but treated in the same manner as other All-Stars who are excused from participation, and he will also be encouraged to attend and be announced at the All-Star Game. 4.

They are to be observed by all parties: 1.   All accredited press, radio and TV representatives shall have pre- game access to the clubhouse from three hours and 30 minutes prior to game time until one hour prior to game time, except that: (a) the media shall not have access to the clubhouse when a club is on the field for batting practice; and (b) the media may not return to a clubhouse once a club has taken batting practice. The media shall have pre-game access to the clubhouse for a minimum of 50 minutes prior to the time that a Club mandates that all play- ers take the field for batting practice or other related activities (e.g., stretching). If a Club does not take batting practice, it may not close the clubhouse until the media has been granted a mini- mum of 50 minutes of access. Unless necessary to satisfy the 50-minute requirement, no Club may provide pre-game access prior to three hours and 30 minutes prior to game time. The media shall have access (outside of the clubhouse) to the Club’s man- ager, players or coaches after batting practice to discuss news- worthy events (such as lineup changes, injuries, and workouts) that occur after the clubhouse closes. 2.   Absent unusual circumstances that require a team meeting imme- diately following a game, the working media shall have access to both clubhouses no later than 10 minutes following the final out of each game (including doubleheaders and day/night split admis- sion games). When such unusual circumstances exist, and such instances are expected to be rare, the working media shall have access to the clubhouse no later than 20 minutes following the final out of the game. The Commissioner’s Office reserves the right to require access to the clubhouse 10 minutes following the final out of all games if the “team meeting” exception is abused. 267"},{"page":284,"text":"3.   The working media’s access following a game shall be for a period no longer than one hour unless reasonable access to play- ers is not provided during that time; provided, however, that card- carrying members of the Baseball Writers Association of America (“BBWAA”) will have unlimited access after the post-game open- ing of the clubhouse. If reasonable access is not provided, the clubhouse must remain open. Members of the media, other than BBWAA members, may make arrangements with the club PR Director for extended access. 4.   Media credentials are not transferable. 5.   Clubhouses, the dugouts and the field are off-limits except to appropriate club, Commissioner’s Office personnel and media bearing appropriate credentials. Club credentials are not to be issued to unauthorized personnel. The Commissioner’s Office reserves the right to revoke inappropriately issued credentials. 6.   Players will be available to the media before and after games for interviews. These periods should not be limited except for the pre- game period described in #1 above, and the post-game period described in #2, above. Upon request by the media, players who had key roles in the first game of a doubleheader are to be made available for a time between games. 7.   The trainer’s room and players’ lounge may be off-limits to the media, but each club controls these areas, and it is vital these areas not be used as a sanctuary for players seeking to avoid the media.

Clark Executive Director Major League Baseball Players Association 12 East 49th Street New York, New York 10017 Dear Tony: This letter memorializes certain understandings that the Parties have reached during the negotiations over a successor to the 2017–2021 Basic Agreement. This letter shall be admissible in any arbitration hearing involving an issue addressed herein. A Club has the right under Regulation 2 of the Uniform Player’s Con- tract (“UPC”) to designate the doctors and hospitals furnishing medical care and hospital services to a Player for injuries sustained in the course and within the scope of his employment under his UPC. A Player is entitled under Article XIII(D) of the Basic Agreement to go to a doctor on the second medical opinion list for diagnosis and a second medical evaluation of an employment related illness or injury being treated by the Club physician. The Parties have had a disagreement regarding Club and Player rights when a second medical opinion doctor and a Club physician disagree on the appropriate course of treatment for a Player’s employment-related injury, including but not limited to disagreement over whether medical procedures not yet approved by the United States Food   and   Drug Administration   qualify   as   “reasonable   medical expenses” under Regulation 2 of the UPC. Without attempting to resolve this disagreement, the Parties will continue to attempt to avoid disputes that might otherwise arise between Players and Clubs in this area by, among other things, urging their constituents to agree upon a qualified third physician expert in the appropriate medical specialty who would resolve the dispute between the Club physician and the sec- ond medical opinion doctor as to the appropriate course of treatment. There have been other circumstances in which the Club physician and a Player’s second medical opinion doctor agree that a particular sur- gery is the appropriate course of treatment but the Player and Club dis- agree as to who should perform the surgery. While the Club has the right to designate the doctors and hospitals when a Player is undergo- 271"},{"page":288,"text":"ing a surgery for an employment related injury, the Clubs understand the importance of a Player being comfortable with the physician per- forming any such surgery. As a result, the Office of the Commissioner will continue to advise Clubs that they should take a Player’s reason- able preferences into account when designating doctors to perform sur- gery under Regulation 2. As part of this commitment, the Office of the Commissioner will advise the Clubs that in no event should they force a Player to have a surgery performed by the Club physician but should instead, in any case in which a Player has objected to the surgery being performed by the Club physician, designate another physician to per- form the surgery. Finally, disputes have also arisen with respect to which travel costs are appropriately considered part of the “reasonable medical expenses” for which a Club is responsible under Regulation 2 of the UPC. The par- ties agree that for any surgical procedure, medical exam or other sim- ilar medical appointment conducted under Regulation 2, the Club shall be obligated to provide or reimburse first-class airfare for the player’s companion, but only when travel with a companion has been recom- mended by a treating physician. In addition, the Office of the Com- missioner   recognizes   that   “reasonable   medical   expenses”   include actual and reasonable travel costs associated with required follow-up examination(s) with the surgeon who performed covered surgery, and the Association, on the other hand, recognizes that “reasonable med- ical expenses” would not include travel costs incurred by a Player to see a doctor for routine examination(s) that could have been appropri- ately performed by a local doctor designated by the Club.

All Players will undergo neurocognitive baseline testing dur- ing Spring Training or when they join a Club each season. B.   If a Player is involved in an incident during a game that is associated with a high risk of concussion, the game will be stopped and the Player will be evaluated on the field for a potential concussion by a Certified Athletic Trainer (“ATC”) following   the   National   Athletic   Trainers’ Association (“NATA”) guidelines for management of sports-related con- cussions.

Any change in the Player’s neurological status will result in immediate removal from the game and further evaluation in the clubhouse. 2.

For Use by Medical Professionals Only Player Details  Name: ______________________________________________________ Date of Birth: ________________________________________________ Examiner: ___________________________________________________ Date of Injury: _______________ Time: ___________________________  What Is The SCAT5?  The SCAT5 is a standardized tool for evaluating concussions designed for use by physicians and licensed healthcare professionals. The SCAT5 cannot be performed correctly in less than 10 minutes. Preseason SCAT5 baseline testing can be useful for interpreting post-injury test scores, but is not required for that purpose. Detailed instructions for use of the SCAT5 are provided on page 7. Please read through these instructions carefully before testing a player. Brief verbal instructions for each test are given in italics. The only equipment required for the tester is a watch or timer.  Recognize and Remove  A head impact by either a direct blow or indirect transmission of force can be associated with a serious and potentially fatal brain injury. If there are significant concerns, including any of the red flags listed in Box 1, then acti- vation of emergency procedures and urgent transport to the nearest hospital should be arranged.  Key Points  •   Any   player   with   suspected   concussion   should   be   REMOVED FROM PLAY, medically assessed and monitored for deterioration.  278"},{"page":295,"text":"279 No player diagnosed with concussion should be returned to play on the day of injury. •   Concussion signs and symptoms evolve over time and it is impor- tant to consider repeat evaluation in the assessment of concussion. •   The diagnosis of a concussion is a clinical judgment, made by a medical professional. The SCAT5 should NOT be used by itself to make, or exclude, the diagnosis of concussion. A player may have a concussion even if their SCAT5 is “normal”.  Remember:  •   The basic principles of first aid (danger, response, airway, breathing, circulation) should be followed. •   Do not attempt to move the player (other than that required for air- way management) unless trained to do so. •   Assessment for a spinal cord injury is a critical part of the initial on- field assessment. •   Do not remove a helmet or any other equipment unless trained to do so safely."},{"page":296,"text":"280"},{"page":297,"text":"281"},{"page":298,"text":"282"},{"page":299,"text":"283"},{"page":300,"text":"284"},{"page":301,"text":"285"},{"page":302,"text":"286"},{"page":303,"text":"287"},{"page":304,"text":"SCORING ON THE SCAT5 SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A STAND-ALONE METHOD TO DIAGNOSE CONCUSSION, MEASURE RECOVERY OR MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT A PLAYER’S READINESS TO RETURN TO COMPETITION AFTER CONCUSSION.  288"},{"page":305,"text":"CLINICAL NOTES:  ___________________ ___________________ ___________________ ___________________ ___________________ ________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________  289"},{"page":306,"text":"\"   – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – CONCUSSION INJURY ADVICE  (To be given to the person monitoring the concussed athlete) This player has received an injury to the head.

Recovery time is variable across individuals and the player will need monitoring for a further period. Your treating physi- cian will provide guidance as to this timeframe.  If   you   notice   any   change   in   behavior,   vomiting,   worsening headache, double vision or excessive drowsiness, please telephone your doctor or the nearest hospital emergency department imme- diately.  Other important points:  Initial rest: Limit physical activity to routine daily activities (avoid exercise, training, sports) and limit activities such as screen time to a level that does not worsen symptoms.  1) Avoid alcohol 2) Avoid   prescription   or   non-prescription   drugs   without   medical supervision. Specifically: a) Avoid sleeping tablets b) Do not use aspirin, anti-inflammatory medication or stronger pain medications such as narcotics 3) Do not drive until cleared by a healthcare professional. 4) Return to play requires clearance by a physician and MLB’s Med- ical Director.

At baseline it is advantageous to assess how an athlete “typically” feels whereas during the acute/post-acute stage it is best to ask how the athlete feels at the time of testing. The symptom scale should be completed by the player, not by the examiner. In situations where the symptom scale is being completed after exercise, it should be done in a resting state, generally by approx- imating his resting heart rate. For total number of symptoms, maximum possible is 22 except imme- diately post injury, if sleep item is omitted, which then creates a max- imum of 21. For Symptom severity score, add all scores in table, maximum possible is 22 x 6 = 132, except immediately post injury if sleep item is omitted, which then creates a maximum of 21 x 6=126.  Immediate Memory  The Immediate Memory component can be completed using the 10-word list. The maximum score per trial is 10 with a total trial max- imum of 30. Choose one of the word lists. Then perform 3 trials of immediate memory using this list. Complete all 3 trials regardless of score on previous trials. “ I am going to test your memory. I will read you a list of words and when I am done, repeat back as many words as you can remember, in any order. ” The words must be read at a rate of one word per second.

Total score equals sum across all 3 trials. Do NOT inform the player that delayed recall will be tested.  Concentration Digits Backward  Choose one column of digits from lists A, B, C, D, E or F and admin- ister those digits as follows: Say: “ I am going to read a string of numbers and when I am done, you repeat them back to me in reverse order of how I read them to you. For example, if I say 7-1-9, you would say 9-1-7. ” Begin with first 3 digit string. If correct, circle “Y” for correct and go to next string length. If incor- rect, circle “N” for the first string length and read trial 2 in the same string length. One point possible for each string length. Stop after incorrect on both trials (2 N’s) in a string length. The digits should be read at the rate of one per second.  Months in Reverse Order  “ Now tell me the months of the year in reverse order. Start with the last month and go backward. So you’ll say December, November ...

Tell me as many words from the list as you can remember in any order. ” Score 1 pt. for each correct response  Modified Balance Error Scoring System (mBESS) Testing  This balance testing is based on a modified version of the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS). A timing device is required for this testing. Each of 20-second trial/stance is scored by counting the number of errors. The examiner will begin counting errors only after the player has assumed the proper start position. The modified BESS is calculated 292"},{"page":309,"text":"by adding one error point for each error during the three 20-second tests. The maximum number of errors for any single condition is 10. If the player commits multiple errors simultaneously, only one error is recorded but the player should quickly return to the testing position, and counting should resume once the athlete is set. Players that are unable to maintain the testing procedure for a mini- mum of five seconds at the start are assigned the highest possible score, ten, for that testing condition. OPTION: For further assessment, the same 3 stances can be performed on a surface of medium density foam (e.g., approximately 50cm x 40cm x 6cm).  Balance testing – types of errors  1. Hands lifted off iliac crest 2. Opening eyes 3. Step, stumble or fall 4. Moving hip into > 30 degrees abduction 5. Lifting forefoot or heel 6.

This test will consist of three twenty second tests with different stances. ” (a) Double leg stance: “ The first stance is standing with your feet together with your hands on your hips and with your eyes closed. You should try to maintain stability in that position for 20 seconds. I will be count- ing the number of times you move out of this position. I will start timing when you are set and have closed your eyes. ” (b) Single leg stance:  “If you were to kick a ball, which foot would you use?   [This will be the dominant foot]   Now stand on your non-dominant foot. The dominant leg should be held in approximately 30 degrees of hip flexion and 45 degrees of knee flexion.

Your weight should be evenly distributed across both feet. Again, you should try to maintain stability for 20 seconds with your hands on your hips and your eyes closed. I will be counting the number of times you move out of this position. If you stumble out of this posi- tion, open your eyes and return to the start position and continue balancing. I will start timing when you are set and have closed your eyes. ”  Tandem Gait  Participants are instructed to stand with their feet together behind a starting line (the test is best done with footwear removed). Then, they walk in a forward direction as quickly and as accurately as possible along a 1.5 inch wide (sports tape), 10 foot long line with an alternate foot heel-to-toe gait ensuring that they approximate their heel and toe on each step. Once they cross the end of the 10 foot line, they turn 180 degrees and return to the starting point using the same gait. Athletes fail the test if they step off the line, have a separation between their heel and toe, or if they touch or grab the examiner or an object.  Finger to Nose  “ I am going to test your coordination now. Please sit comfortably on the chair with your eyes open and your arm (either right or left) out- stretched (shoulder flexed to 90 degrees and elbow and fingers extended), pointing in front of you. When I give a start signal, I would like you to perform five successive finger to nose repetitions using your index finger to touch the tip of the nose, and then return to the starting position, as quickly and as accurately as possible. ” 294"},{"page":311,"text":"CONCUSSION INFORMATION Any player suspected of having a concussion should be removed from play and receive medical evaluation.

Remember, it is better to be safe. Rest & Rehabilitation  After a concussion, the player should have physical rest and relative cognitive rest for a few days to allow their symptoms to improve. In most cases, after no more than a few days of rest, the player should gradually increase their daily activity level as long as their symptoms do not worsen. Once the player is able to complete their usual daily activities without concussion-related symptoms, the second step of the return to play progression can be started. The player should not return to play until their concussion-related symptoms have resolved and the player has successfully returned to full activities and cleared by MLB’s Medical Director. When returning to play, the player should follow a stepwise,   medically managed exercise progression, with increasing amounts of exer- cise .

Pursuant to Article XX(B)(3), a Qualifying Offer must provide a salary equal to the average salary of the 125 highest-paid Players for the prior season, except that a Qualifying Offer may not pro- vide a salary below the Qualifying Offer for the 2017 season. 1.   The 125 highest-paid Players initially shall be derived from all Players   on   a   40-man   roster   (or   whose   contracts   have   been assigned outright) or 60-Day Injured List on August 31 of the most recently completed season (“Eligible Players”). In addition, Players who retired (whether or not they are placed on the Volun- tary Retired List) or are placed on the Restricted List between the conclusion of the prior championship season and August 31 of the most recently completed championship season shall be considered Eligible Players, but only for the first year following such retire- ment or placement on the Restricted List. 2.   In determining the 125 highest-paid Players, each Player’s salary for the season at issue (“Salary”) shall be calculated by adding the following: (i) the Player’s base salary for the year at issue (adjusted pursuant to any salary escalator effective for that sea- son); (ii) a prorated portion of any applicable signing bonus; (iii) a prorated portion of any buyout associated with the first Club or Mutual option year of the Contract (or a deduction of the amount of the buyout if the option was exercised as described in Adden- dum A); and (iv) any bonuses that were earned by the Player as of the conclusion of the championship season. If any portion of the Player’s earnings in items (i)-(iv) of this paragraph is deferred, his 311"},{"page":328,"text":"Salary shall be discounted pursuant to the formula set forth in Addendum A. 3.   If a Player is not an Eligible Player because his Major League Uniform Player’s Contract (“UPC”) covering the season at issue was terminated between the conclusion of the prior championship season and August 31 of the recently completed championship season, and, following the termination, the Player was owed the remaining salary for the recently completed championship season as termination pay, the Player’s Salary under his terminated UPC (as calculated pursuant to paragraph 2 above) shall be included in determining the 125 highest-paid Players. Except as set forth in paragraph 4 below, if a Player was signed to more than one UPC covering the applicable season, the UPC that results in the highest Salary under the calculation set forth in paragraph 2 above (including a terminated UPC covered by paragraph 2 above) will be used to determine the 125 highest-paid Players. 4.   If a Player and Club replace a UPC during the championship sea- son with a new UPC covering that season, the Player’s base salary,   pro-rata   signing   bonus   and   pro-rata   buyout   for   that championship season for purposes of Section 2(i)-(iii) above will be sum of the following: (1) the base salary, pro-rata signing bonus and pro-rata buyout under the first UPC for that season each shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the championship season that the Player was covered by the UPC and the denominator is the number of days in that championship season; and (2) the base salary, pro-rata signing bonus, and pro-rata buyout under the new UPC for that season each shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the championship season that the Player was covered by the new UPC and the denominator is the number of days in that championship season. 5.   If a Player is not signed to a Major League UPC as of Opening Day, but signs a UPC during the championship season, the base salary under that UPC for purposes of Section 2(i) above will be determined by multiplying the base salary under the UPC by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the championship season that the Player was covered by the UPC and the denominator is the number of days in the championship season. 312"},{"page":329,"text":"6.

Deferred Compensation If a Uniform Player’s Contract contains compensation that is payable beyond the guaranteed term of the Contract, such compensation shall be considered “deferred compensation”. All deferred compensation shall be included in a Player’s Salary in the year in which it is earned at an amount equal to the discounted present value of such deferred amount.

Any contract that would result in a Club exceeding its Signing Bonus Pool (including any additional Signing Bonus Pool space acquired via assignment from another Club) will not be approved by the Commissioner’s Office. 6.   If a Club does not spend or assign its entire Signing Bonus Pool for a given signing period, the remaining Signing Bonus Pool space expires at the close of the signing period and does not carry over to the following signing period. 7.   If a player’s contract is not approved, voided ab initio, or ter- minated during the signing period in which it is entered based on the results of an Age and Identity investigation conducted by the Office of the Commissioner, a failed physical exami- nation, or the inability of the player to obtain a visa to work in the United States, the portion of the Signing Bonus that is not paid to the player or is recouped from the player as a result of such action will not be counted against the Club’s Signing Bonus Pool for that signing period.

In each signing period, signing bonuses provided to players of $10,000 or less will not count against a Club’s Signing Bonus Pool. C.   Signing Period For purposes of determining compliance with a Club’s Signing Bonus Pool, a signing period shall commence at 9 A.M. Eastern Time on January 15 and end at 5 P.M. Eastern Time on December 15 of that same calendar year. The period starting at 5 P.M. East- ern Time on December 15 and ending at 9 A.M.

The Office of the Commissioner shall give the Association written notice of any action by a Club voiding a contract pursuant to this sub- section D.2. E.   Assignment of Signing Bonus Pool Space 1.   During the remainder of the current (2021-2022) signing period, no Club may assign to another Club any of its avail- able Signing Bonus Pool space. 2.   Beginning in the 2023 signing period and continuing there- after, Clubs may assign to other Clubs any of their available Signing Bonus Pool space; provided, however, that no Club may acquire by assignment from another Club (or Clubs) in aggregate more than 60% of its Signing Bonus Pool at the commencement of any signing period. 3.   Signing Bonus Pool space may only be assigned in incre- ments of $250,000, unless the Club is assigning its entire remaining Signing Bonus Pool in a single transaction. 4.   In any assignment of Signing Bonus Pool space from one Club to another Club, the Signing Bonus Pool of the assignor Club will be reduced by the amount of the assigned space, and the Signing Bonus Pool of the assignee Club will be increased by the amount of the assigned space. 5.   Cash consideration of any kind is not permitted to be included in a trade involving Signing Bonus Pool space unless the cash consideration is included to offset the salary obligation of another player included in the assignment (and is no greater than   such   obligations),   subject   to   the   Commissioner’s approval. 6.   A Club may only assign its Signing Bonus Pool space for a given signing period during the term of that signing period.

For purposes of this provision, a “Media Report” is either a published report or a pre-publication inquiry from a media member to verify accuracy. For these purposes, a report of a “Contract Offer” is a report of the existence and/or terms of a contract offer purportedly made by or to a Club. In response to a Media Report of a Contract Offer, a player (or a rep- resentative of a player) or a Club may offer one of the following responses: (a)   state that the player or Club declines to comment about any negotiations between the player and the Club; (b)   confirm or deny that the player and Club are engaged in dis- cussions, but (if discussions are ongoing) decline to comment about the substance of those negotiations; (c)   confirm or deny that an offer has been made, but (if confirm- ing) state that the details provided in the story or in the inquiry are not accurate; or (d)   confirm that the offer has been made and that the details are accurate. In providing the above responses, a Club or player (or representa- tive of a player) may not volunteer any information regarding the Contract Offer.

I.   Definitions.  Domestic violence   is a pattern of abusive behavior in any intimate relationship that is used by one partner to gain or maintain power and control over another intimate partner. It occurs in heterosex- ual and same sex relationships and impacts individuals from all economic, educational, cultural, age, gender, racial, and religious demographics. Domestic violence includes, but is not limited to, physical   or   sexual   violence,   emotional   and/or   psychological intimidation, verbal violence, stalking, economic control, harass- ment, physical intimidation, or injury.

Sexual assault   refers to a range of behaviors, including a com- pleted nonconsensual sex act, an attempted nonconsensual sex act, and/or nonconsensual sexual contact. Lack of consent is inferred when a person uses force, harassment, threat of force, threat of adverse personnel or disciplinary action, or other coer- cion, or when the victim is asleep, incapacitated, unconscious or legally incapable of consent.  Child abuse   is any act or failure to act on the part of a parent or caretaker which results in death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation of a child who is under the age of 18 or not an emancipated minor, or any act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk of such harm to such a child. “Child Abuse” also includes the production, distribution, receipt, or possession of “child pornography,” defined as any visual depic- tion, including any photograph, film, video, picture, or computer or computer-generated image or picture, whether made or pro- duced by electronic, mechanical, or other means, of sexually explicit conduct, where the production of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct. This policy covers acts of child abuse, domestic violence and sex- ual assault (“Covered Acts”) as defined above.  II.   Investigation of Incidents. A.   Process.   The procedures set forth in this Policy shall be trig- gered when the Commissioner’s Office provides the Players Association with written notification that it is investigating an allegation that a Player has engaged in a Covered Act (“Notification”). Unless otherwise expressly stated, the Basic Agreement remains in effect and its relevant provisions apply under this Policy.  B.   Administrative Leave.

Alternatively, the Commissioner’s Office may defer placing the Player on Administrative Leave until the Player is either charged with a crime by law enforcement, or the Com- missioner’s Office receives credible information corroborat- ing the allegations. The Commissioner’s placement of a Player on Administrative Leave shall not be considered dis- ciplinary under this Policy.  1.   Challenge   to   Administrative   Leave   Placement.  Although Administrative   Leave   under   paragraph   B above is not disciplinary, a Player placed on such leave may request an in-person or telephonic hearing before the Grievance Arbitration Panel (the “Arbitration Panel”) within 24 hours of such request to seek reinstatement to the active roster while the Commissioner’s Office inves- tigates the allegations. The Arbitration Panel shall issue a ruling on such reinstatement request within 24 hours of the close of the hearing. If the Arbitrator is not available in that time frame, the request shall be heard by an alter- nate Arbitrator selected by the Parties pursuant to Article XI(A)(10) of the Basic Agreement. The Arbitration Panel shall remove the Player from Administrative Leave if it determines   that   (a)   the   allegations   that   the   Player engaged in a Covered Act are not supported by credible information, or (b) that allowing the Player to remain active during the Commissioner’s Office’s investigation is consistent with the safety of the victim(s) and will not cause significant disruption to the Player’s Club.  2.

Upon the conclusion of the initial period of Administrative Leave (including any extension thereof), if any, the Commissioner may rein- state the Player from the Restricted List and return him from Administrative Leave, may impose immediate dis- cipline on the Player, may request that the Players Asso- ciation   further   extend   the   period   of Administrative Leave, may defer a disciplinary determination until a later date, or may impose a paid suspension pending res- olution of legal proceedings as described in Section III.C.2 below.  a.

The Commis- sioner’s Office may request that the initial period of Administrative   Leave   (including   any   extension thereof) be extended in order for it to complete its investigation. The Players Association shall consider such a request in good faith.

In addition, a Player’s failure to comply with his Treatment Plan adopted pursuant to Section IV below may be an inde- pendent violation of this Policy.

Initial authority to discipline Players for events that include violations of this Policy (including all aspects of the incident from which the alleged violation arose) shall repose with the Commissioner’s Office.

Such a transfer may occur at any time before the completion of the Commis- sioner’s Office investigation, but no later than that date. If   the   Commissioner’s   Office   does   not   transfer   its authority, no Club may take any disciplinary or adverse action against a Player arising from an incident involv- ing a Covered Act; except that nothing in this section is intended to address whether (i) a Club may take adverse action in response to a Player’s failure to render his serv- ices due to a disability resulting directly from a physical injury or mental condition arising from his violation of the Policy, or (ii) a Club may withhold salary from a Player for any period he is unavailable because of legal proceedings or incarceration arising from his violation of the Policy. If the Commissioner’s Office notifies a Club, the Player and the Players Association that the Commissioner’s Office will not impose discipline, a Club may discipline a Player who commits a Covered Act for just cause, regardless of whether the Commis- sioner’s Office had previously placed the player on Administrative Leave pursuant to this policy or con- ducted an investigation. A decision by the Commis- sioner to defer his disciplinary decision pursuant to Section II.B(7)(c) shall not trigger a Club’s right to dis- cipline in an absence of a notification to the Club, the Player and the Players Association that the Commis- sioner will not impose discipline. The fact that a Club rather than the Commissioner imposed discipline on a Player shall not be relied on by a Player in challenging whether the discipline was supported by just cause. 342"},{"page":359,"text":"2.

C.   Just Cause.   This Policy arises in part from the increased recognition and understanding of the seriousness and harm resulting from Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse. As a result, precedent and past practice under the Basic Agreement regarding the discipline of Players for Covered Acts are not relevant in assessing discipline under this Policy. The Arbitration Panel may consider precedent from past cases not involving Covered Acts. In evaluating the just cause of the level of discipline imposed under the Policy, the Arbitration Panel may consider aggravating and mitigating factors where relevant and appropriate.  1.   Forms of Discipline.  The discipline imposed by the Commissioner or a Club may include any discipline authorized by the Basic Agreement or the Uniform Player’s Contract.  2.   Paid Suspension Pending Resolution of Criminal Matter. a.   In certain cases, the Commissioner may decide that he is not in a position to impose discipline until the resolution of a criminal or legal proceeding, but that allowing the Player to play during the pendency of the criminal or legal proceeding would result in sub- stantial and irreparable harm to either the Club or Major League Baseball. In such exceptional cases, the Commissioner may suspend the Player with pay pending resolution of the criminal or legal proceed- ing (or until the Commissioner determines that he has just cause to impose an unpaid, disciplinary sus- pension).  b.

The Commis- sioner’s Office and Players Association shall agree on a written payment schedule, in the form of an order issued by the Arbitration Panel, which will result in the full repayment of the money owed by the Player to his Club.  c.   The Arbitration Panel shall have jurisdiction to review a challenge by a Player or the Players Asso- ciation of a paid suspension pending resolution of a criminal matter against the standard of prior arbitral precedent.  D.   Procedures for Challenging Discipline Imposed by the Commissioner. 1.   Arbitration Panel Review.   The Arbitration Panel shall have jurisdiction to review a challenge by a Player or the Players Association of any discipline imposed under the Policy, except as otherwise limited herein. As already noted, the procedures for challenging discipline set forth in the Basic Agreement apply except as otherwise stated herein.  2.   Conduct of Arbitration.   The Players Association and the Player will be represented during the Grievance Pro- cedure and arbitration proceedings only by in-house counsel of the Players Association and/or by outside counsel appointed by the Player Association. The Com- missioner’s Office will be represented only by in-house counsel of the Commissioner’s Office and/or by outside counsel appointed by the Commissioner’s Office.  3.   Discovery.

In any case involving discipline imposed under this Policy, the Commissioner’s Office shall have the burden of proving that the Player commit- ted a Covered Act:  a.   A criminal conviction for an offense involving a Covered Act or a plea of guilty, no contest or   nolo contendere , to an offense involving a Covered Act, whether a misdemeanor or felony, shall satisfy the Commissioner’s Office’s burden of proving a viola- tion.

A Player may be subjected to disciplinary action for just cause by the Commissioner for a violation of this Policy in the absence of a conviction or a plea of guilty to a crime involving a Covered Act.  5.   Suspensions. a.   Unless otherwise provided herein, all suspensions under this Policy shall be without pay, and the Player will be placed on the Restricted List and will not accrue Major League service. A Player sus- pended during the offseason under this Policy will be placed on the Restricted List immediately upon public announcement.  b.

The Joint Policy Board shall be responsible for evaluating, and where treatment is appropriate, supervising the treatment of Players who have committed or are alleged to have committed Covered Acts. It may also provide evaluation and treatment to Players who voluntarily request the Board’s assistance.  B.   Composition of Joint Policy Board.

The Expert Representatives shall all serve one-year terms, renewable by agreement of the Parties.  C.   Referral to Joint Policy Board. 1.   A Player will be referred to the Joint Policy Board for an “Initial Evaluation” which will be an “initial wellness check,” defined as a preliminary evaluation conducted jointly by the two party medical representatives on the Joint Policy Board as to whether the player poses an immediate threat to himself and/or others, when the Commissioner’s Office provides the Notification refer- enced in Section II.A above.

The Commissioner may discipline a Player who commits a Covered Act (whether or not the same person was involved in the initial complaint), including a Player in a Treatment Plan under this Policy.  2.   Except as provided in Section F.1 above, a majority vote of the Joint Policy Board will determine whether the Player has violated his Treatment Plan. If the Player has done so, he will be subject to discipline for just cause solely by the Commissioner pursuant to Section III above. Before making its determination, the Player or his repre- sentative may provide information to the Joint Policy Board in the Player’s defense. The Joint Policy Board will make its determination whether a Player has failed to cooperate with a Full Evaluation, or comply with a Treat- ment Plan, by applying the following criteria:  a.   A Player who refuses to submit to a Full Evaluation, including any follow-up meetings or tests requested by the Expert Representative, will be deemed to have violated his Treatment Plan.  b.   A Player who consistently fails to participate in mandatory sessions with his assigned health care professional will be deemed to have failed to com- ply with his Treatment Plan.  c.

V.   Return to Active Status.   All returns to active status for a Player from a suspension that is upheld (or not challenged) are subject to a certification of fitness from his assigned health care professional and an agreement by the Player to adhere going for- ward to any Plan prescribed by the Joint Policy Board.  VI. Confidentiality.   The confidentiality of Player information is essential to the success of this Policy. To ensure that confidential- ity is protected, the Parties agree to the following confidentiality provisions:  A.   Definition.   All information related to, arising from or con- sidered in connection with the evaluation, counseling and treatment of a Player by the Joint Policy Board, and all infor- mation obtained by the Commissioner’s Office through its investigation of an alleged Covered Act, is confidential, pro- vided that this definition excludes information that has previ- ously been made public or is made public by a source other than the Player, the Players Association or the Commis- sioner’s Office.  B.   Prohibition on Disclosure.   The Commissioner’s Office, the Players Association, the Clubs, the Joint Policy Board and any third parties who are consulted under this Policy are pro- hibited from disclosing confidential information that they already possess as defined above, except (i) in connection with or in anticipation of a grievance or potential grievance involving discipline or potential discipline under this Policy; (ii) to inform the Player’s Club of the Player’s treatment under the Policy; (iii) where necessary to effectively admin- ister a Player’s treatment under the Policy; or (iv) where dis- closure is required by law, including court order, and is not 351"},{"page":368,"text":"subject to any claim of privilege. If the Commissioner’s Office or the Joint Policy Board or any of their agents receive a subpoena or other legal process seeking confidential infor- mation, the Commissioner’s Office will notify the Players Association and give it an opportunity to intervene and oppose disclosure of the confidential information. Each Party is responsible for ensuring that the individuals to whom they disclose confidential information under this Policy maintain the confidentiality of the information, and each Party will be deemed responsible for any unauthorized disclosures by per- sons to whom they provide confidential information.  C.   Public   Disclosure   of   Discipline.   The   Commissioner’s Office may issue a statement announcing (i) the discipline of a Player under this Policy, including the length of any sus- pension, (ii) that a Player has been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation under the Policy, or (iii) that the Commissioner’s Office has stayed its investigation of an alleged incident under this Policy pending resolution of a criminal matter. The Commissioner’s Office will not other- wise make announcements related to Covered Acts or alleged Covered Acts under this Policy. Notwithstanding the forego- ing, if a Player, the Players Association or the Player’s repre- sentative makes statements challenging the discipline or denying the alleged conduct, the Commissioner’s Office may make   a   statement   in   response   to   such   comments.   The Player’s Club may issue a public statement in response to the announcement of a Player’s discipline under this Policy, pro- vided that a draft of the statement is sent to the Players Asso- ciation at least sixty (60) minutes prior to its issuance, and the Club considers in good faith any comments provided by the Players Association.   If   allegations   related   to   a   Player’s alleged violation of the Policy become public through a source other than the Commissioner’s Office, a Club or their respective agents, the Commissioner’s Office may issue a public statement that it is conducting an investigation of the allegations, and the Players Association may issue a public statement that it is monitoring the situation.

VII. Training, Education and Community Outreach. A.   Training/Education Committee.   The Parties shall form a joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Policy Committee (“Policy Committee”) that will be com- prised of three representatives of the Players Association, three representatives of the Commissioner’s Office, and an outside non-voting Domestic Violence, Child Abuse and/or Sexual Assault specialist who shall be selected jointly by the Parties.

All aspects of the train- ing and education program, including the frequency and content of training and the selection of the training staff, shall be determined jointly by the Parties through the Policy Committee. All training and education shall be presented in English and Spanish, and any statements made by Players in such training or education sessions shall be kept strictly confidential by the individuals conducting the training.  C.   Community   Outreach.   The   Policy   Committee   will develop an annual program of public outreach on the topic of domestic violence and other crimes against women.

Family   Resources.   The   Parties,   through   the   Policy Committee, shall develop a plan for the publication of referral information, websites, and resources (including hotlines, shelters and outreach facilities) for spouses, partners and families of Players in every Major League city, Spring Training site and in the home countries of all Players.  IX. Funding.  All programs pursuant to this Policy shall be jointly funded through either the Industry Growth Fund or the International Tax Fund.  X.   Comparable Programs for MLB, Club, and PA Personnel.  The Parties agree that Major League Baseball, its affiliated busi- nesses, every Club and the Players Association shall institute Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Policies that are comparable both in terms of scope and discipline for their respective employees, managers, executives, and owners.

Specifically, we have agreed that a Player who finishes first-or second-place in vot- ing for his League’s Rookie of the Year Award in a season in which that Player qualified as an Eligible Prospect (as defined in Major League Rule 4( l )(1)) entering that season shall be credited with a full year of credited Major League service (i.e., 172 days of Major League service) for that season, irrespective of how many days of credited Major League service he otherwise would have accrued for that season pur- suant to Article XXI of the Basic Agreement.

Specifically, the Parties have agreed as follows: 1.   The fact that a Player leaves the bullpen during an on-field inci- dent will be considered an aggravating factor in determining the appropriate level of discipline for that Player, should he oth- erwise act in a manner that warrants discipline (e.g., instigating or committing an act of violence), but will not constitute inde- pendent grounds for discipline and cannot elevate an appropri- ate level of discipline from a fine to a suspension. 2.   Except as set forth in Attachment 28, in the event that disci- pline issued to a Player for conduct on the playing field or in the ballpark includes a fine, the Player shall have the choice to pay the fine to the Baseball Assistance Team (“BAT”) or the MLB-MLBPA Youth Development Foundation. Notwithstand- ing the foregoing, every fourth $1,000 fine issued by the Senior Vice President, On-Field Operations (or comparable title/posi- tion) or the Commissioner for a pitcher intentionally throwing at a batter shall be paid to the Player’s Trust. 3.

The Office of the Commissioner and the Major League Base- ball Players Association (the “Association”) hereby agree as follows: 1.   As referenced in this Agreement “wearable technology” refers to any equipment, program, software, device or attire which is designed to collect and/or analyze information or data related to a Player’s health or performance at any location (including on-field, off- field and/or away from the ballpark). Such technologies include, with- out limitation: activity trackers, electronic bat sensors, biomechanics compression attire, GPS/tracking compression attire and any device, sensor, equipment, attire or dashboard technology which is designed to measure a Player’s health, performance and/or readiness. 2.   Any use of a wearable technology by a Player (including use on-field, off-field and/or away from the ballpark) shall be wholly vol- untary and Clubs must refrain from making any suggestion that the use of such technology is anything less than wholly voluntary. There will be no consequences to a Player if he declines to use any wearable tech- nology, or if he discontinues his use of such a technology. 3.

In addition, all such Data must be destroyed or permanently deleted in the event a Player requests to have such Data destroyed or deleted, in which case a Player may request a copy of his data prior to its destruction or deletion. Only the following Club representatives (and individuals working at the direc- tion of such representatives) shall be permitted access to Wearable Data: General Manager, Assistant General Manager, Field Manager, Team Physician, Certified Athletic Trainer, Strength and Conditioning Coach, Rehabilitation Coordinator and an individual hired by a Club to manage the use and administration of wearable technology. A Player may request in writing that the Club further restrict or expand the list of representatives who will have access to such information and data. If the Club does not comply with such a request, the Player may decline to use or discontinue his use of the wearable technology. 5.   Any commercial use or exploitation of such information or data by a Club, Major League Baseball, or any Major League Baseball- related entity or other third party is strictly prohibited. 6.   No Player may use a wearable technology in games or pre- game activities (e.g., batting practice)—and no Club may request that a Player use a wearable technology in games or pre-game activities— unless it has been approved by Major League Baseball in accordance with Official Baseball Rule 3.09 (Note).

The JCWT will review the potential use of any new wearable technology in games or pre-game activities, and shall make a recommendation to the PRC regarding whether to approve such technology.

The JCWT also shall meet and confer biannually to discuss issues relating to Player safety, data management, privacy and confi- dentiality and any other topics which are deemed relevant by two or more members of the Committee. If the Office of the Commissioner or the Association becomes aware that a non-approved wearable technol- ogy is being used in games or pre-game activities, the Commissioner’s Office or the Association, as the case may be, shall notify the other party in writing and the JCWT shall promptly confer to discuss a rec- ommendation to the PRC. 8.

Specifically, the Parties hereby agree as follows:  A.   One-Way Microphones  The Parties agree to maintain the   status quo   with respect to one-way   microphones;   provided,   however,   that,   upon request, the Association will provide reasonable cooperation to facilitate players wearing one-way microphones during nationally-televised and/or nationally-streamed games.

(2) Stipends. Each   active   Player   who   wears   a   two-way microphone at the request of the Commissioner’s Office for at least one full inning will receive a stipend of $10,000 per championship season game, which will increase to $15,000 per game for the postseason. Players must participate in the relevant game in order to be eligi- ble for the two-way microphone stipend (i.e., players who wear two-way microphones during games in which they are not playing will not be eligible for the stipend).

However, if for any reason a broadcast partner decides that less than a full inning is needed, the applicable stipend will be paid in full. Stipends will not exceed $500,000 in aggregate in any year and will be paid for out of the International Tax Fund. The Parties will ensure that no Player is asked to wear a two-way microphone when the $500,000 aggre- gate stipend pool has been or may be exhausted. All stipends shall be paid within thirty (30) days following the date the microphone was worn.

Microphone Content Controls  (1) Audio from one-way microphones may be telecast only on a delayed basis during the telecast. The network is not permitted to play back any remarks (regardless of the language in which such remarks were spoken) or other audio   from   one-way   microphones   which   (i)   would embarrass, be prejudicial to, detrimental to, or critical of, Major League Baseball, the Players Association, the individual wearing the microphone, Players, fans or umpires; (ii) include any profanity (regardless of whether the profanity was bleeped out or otherwise deleted or modified with other sounds); or (iii) likely would be con- strued as inflammatory. (2) Audio from two-way microphones may be used in live situations (or with minimal delays) during broadcasts. (3) Unless the Parties agree otherwise, the network and/or any entity authorized by MLB to record audio from microphones shall be required to: (i) provide to MLB Properties any and all audio from game worn micro- phones capturing the voice of a Player, or containing remarks about a Player, that is not used in the telecast; and (ii) destroy or permanently delete while on-site all 366"},{"page":383,"text":"files (including back-up or copies of any kind) contain- ing such audio, and provide written certification to a sen- ior representative at MLB Properties and the Players Association   that   such   destruction   or   deletion   has occurred.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Commissioner’s Office, the 30 Major League Clubs, and the Players Association will be permitted use audio from player- worn microphones on its social media platforms in a manner consistent with Section (C)(1) above, and the Parties’ past practice with respect to secondary usage. If, following an initial warning, a broadcast partner telecasts content from one-way player-worn microphones that violates the content controls set forth in Section (C)(1) above the amount of the stipend paid to a player who wears a two-way microphone for that broadcast partner for the remainder of the season shall increase $500 for each game in which a violation occurs. In addition, the Parties will coordinate with the broadcast partner to determine what, if any, additional protections can be put in place to prevent a subsequent violation of this agree- ment. In the event that the Parties and the relevant broad- cast partner cannot reach an agreement on satisfactory protections, such partner will be prohibited from captur- ing and/or telecasting miking content for the remainder of the season, unless the Parties agree otherwise. The Commissioner’s Office will ensure that all broadcast partners receive written notice (with periodic reminders) of the content protections in this agreement.  D.   Microphone Logistics  Microphone devices will be affixed on Players at a time and in a manner that will not intrude on the Player’s preparation for or participation in a game. A Player may ask that a micro- phone be removed at any time for any reason, and such request will be honored. Additionally, broadcast partners will consider Players’ preference regarding the timing (i.e., which inning or half innings) that two-way microphone content will 367"},{"page":384,"text":"be provided.

A.   Safety  1.   Clubs shall include in their fan policies a prohibition against betting-related, abusive fan speech and behavior that is directed at Players, Players’ family members, Club person- nel, or umpires. 2.   Clubs shall include in their ballpark security plans measures to prevent spectators from entering the field of play and other restricted areas (e.g., bullpens), and also measures to protect any areas of the ballpark designated for seating of Player family and guests. 3.   The Parties will jointly develop a safety hotline for Players to report any threats, potentially threatening communications, or other inappropriate sports betting- related conduct or con- tact that a Player or any member his family receives related to sports betting (e.g., social media messages threatening vio- lence as retribution for a gambler’s losses). The Office of the Commissioner and the Players Association will each receive notice of any Player or Player family member call to the hot- line and will collaborate with respect to any appropriate next steps deemed necessary to protect the Player and/or his fam- ily (e.g., contacting law enforcement with the Player’s per- mission). 4.   No betting lines on Player-specific performance or other Player-specific betting- related information may be displayed 379"},{"page":396,"text":"on in-stadium videoboards or other in-stadium signage dur- ing a game or during pre-game warm-ups. 5.

For the avoidance of doubt, confidential personal medical information shall not include information that is permitted to be disclosed publicly in accordance with the   Basic Agreement,   including Article   XIII(C), Article XIII(G), and Attachment 5. For purposes of this prohibition, personal biometric data means any information about a Player representing or derived from his DNA, heart rate, blood pressure, perspiration rate, internal or external body temperature, hormone levels, glucose levels, hydration lev- els, vitamin levels, bone density, muscle density, or sleep pat- terns. Any statistical information regarding or derived from Player activities in ballpark (including any time that gates are open to admit fans), other than confidential personal medical information, personal biometric data, or non-public data used to evaluate player performance in practices or training ses- sions, shall not be subject to restriction under this section.  B.   Investigations, Discipline & Grievance Procedure  1.   The Office of the Commissioner and the Players Association will maintain confidentiality over documents and informa- tion collected in connection with an investigation into a potential violation of Major League Rule 21(d) or the Policy by a Player (or Players) (“Confidential Information”). For purposes of this provision, maintaining confidentiality over Confidential Information shall mean not disclosing or dis- seminating the Confidential Information publicly or to any third party (other than the Office of the Commissioner, the Association, and their respective employees and agents); pro- vided, however, that the Commissioner’s Office and Associ- ation may disclose Confidential Information at any time (i) in connection with the Office of the Commissioner’s investiga- tion (e.g., providing to outside attorneys, contractors, or con- 380"},{"page":397,"text":"sultants; sharing with potential fact or expert witnesses, etc.); (ii) to federal, state or local officials, or gaming operators, (iii) in response to legal process; or (iv) where the allegation of sports-betting misconduct at issue, or the Confidential Information itself, has been made public or otherwise leaked or provided to the media by a source other than the Commis- sioner’s Office or a Club. 2.   In the event the Commissioner’s Office intends to disclose Confidential Information based on (iv) in Paragraph B.1. above, the Commissioner’s Office shall provide the Associa- tion with notice prior to disclosing any Confidential Informa- tion. Such notice shall include the Confidential Information the Commissioner’s Office intends to disclose and identify the individuals and/or entities to whom the Commissioner’s Office intends to disclose the Confidential Information. Fur- ther, the Commissioner’s Office shall redact the names of all Players from any Confidential Information disclosed pur- suant to (iv) except that the Commissioner’s Office does not have to redact the name of a player who has been disciplined for violating this policy and whose discipline has been upheld (in whole or in part) by the Arbitration Panel (or oth- erwise agreed to by the Association). 3.   The confidentiality requirements in Paragraphs B.1 and B.2 above no longer apply following the conclusion of an inves- tigation that does not result in Player discipline or after a Player has been disciplined and the discipline has been upheld (in whole or in part) by the Arbitration Panel (or oth- erwise agreed to by the Association), except that: (a)   If no discipline is imposed following the investigation, then all Player names shall be redacted prior to the issuance of any public report or other public disclosure regarding the investigation. (b)   The Commissioner’s Office may announce the suspen- sion of a Player based on a violation of Rule 21(d) or the Policy prior to a decision by the Arbitration Panel, including the fact that the discipline was for violating Rule 21(d) or the Policy (as applicable).

Grievances challenging Player discipline for violations of the Policy, Rule 21(d), or any other Player discipline related to sports betting shall be handled on an expedited basis.  C.   Education & Miscellaneous  1.   Each off-season, the Parties shall meet and confer for the pur- pose of developing enhanced education, training, and safety programs to be presented to Players during Spring Training, at the Rookie Program, and on an as needed basis upon mutual agreement. The initial meeting shall take place no later than the conclusion of the Winter Meetings. 2.   The Parties will also meet and confer each off-season (or more often, as needed) to discuss existing, emerging, or anticipated issues in the area of sports betting, including but not limited to: betting technology (e.g., in-stadium mobile betting), integrity monitoring, government investigations, legislation/lobbying, sponsorship and promotion, issues aris- ing in other sports leagues, and any other issues raised by the Parties. 3.

Committee: a.   The Commissioner’s Office and MLBPA will continue to delegate to the Safety and Health Advisory Committee (“Committee”) issues associated with broken bats. The Committee, which serves an advisory role, shall comprise an equal number of representatives appointed by the Play- ers Association and the Commissioner’s Office, and shall make recommendations to the Parties on the subject of bat safety. Following the conclusion of each season, the Com- mittee’s consultants will issue an end of season report which summarizes the data collected on broken bats dur- ing the season. b.   The Committee shall meet upon the conclusion of each season to discuss potential revisions to the bat regulations for the next season based on the data from the prior season and the recommendations of the consultants. If the Parties agree to amend the Bat Supplier Regulations based on the recommendation of the Committee (or its consultants), they shall use their best efforts to do so by November 15 in order to provide Clubs, Players and bat manufacturers with sufficient notice of any agreed-upon changes to the regulations. 400"},{"page":417,"text":"2.   Consultations: a.   Players: By November 15 each year, the Committee’s consultants will submit to the Parties a list of Players who incurred a high number of multiple-piece bat failures (“MPFs”) during the prior season. Each Player on the list will be required to complete a preseason consultation with the MLBPA and the Committee’s consultants, at which the Player will be provided with information and advice regarding   the   selection   of   bat   models   to   reduce   the Player’s MPFs. The Committee will evaluate the consulta- tion program annually to determine whether additional adjustments are necessary in subsequent seasons. b.   Manufacturers: By November 15 each year, the Commit- tee’s consultants will determine whether any manufactur- ers had a large percentage of MPFs relative to total sales. The Committee’s consultants, with participation by the Commissioner’s Office and MLBPA if practical, will con- duct   conferences   with   the   identified   manufacturers, including, if feasible, at the Winter Meetings. The manu- facturers will receive notice of the conference requirement and its covered subjects no later than December 1. During each conference, the following information will be dis- cussed with each manufacturer: i.   The models of bats produced by the manufacturers that the consultants view as problematic, and the con- sultants’ recommendations for improving the durabil- ity of those models; ii.   Players whose bats had a high MPF rate during prior seasons, and the consultants’ recommendations for improving the durability of those bats; and iii. The manufacturers’ adherence to the slope of grain requirements, and the consultants’ recommendations for improving compliance. Manufacturers participating in the conferences will be informed that the Committee strongly desires for the MPF rate of their bat models to decline in the next season, and that the performance of their bats will be closely moni- 401"},{"page":418,"text":"tored. At the end of each consultation, the manufacturer will be required to submit to the consultants and the Com- mittee a plan for reducing MPFs in the next season. The consultants will provide a progress report to the Parties by July 1 of each year on the performance of the bats pro- duced by these manufacturers. c.   Midseason: At the conclusion of each month during the championship season, the Committee’s consultants will make a recommendation regarding any Player or manufac- turer that they believe should be subject to a midseason consultation regarding the MPF rates of his or its bats. These consultations will be conducted in accordance with the format set forth in paragraph 2(a) (Players) and para- graph 2(b) (manufacturers). The Committee will evaluate the midseason consultation program annually to determine whether additional adjustments are necessary in subse- quent seasons. 3.   Audits: The Committee’s consultants will administer a pro- gram of manufacturer audits each season consistent with the program that was administered during the 2011 season. The Committee will evaluate the auditing program annually to determine whether additional adjustments are necessary in subsequent seasons. 4.   New Players: No Player who signed his first Major League contract for the 2011 season or 2012 season may order (or have ordered on his behalf) a sugar maple bat that has a wood density less than 0.0240 lbs/in 3   when at 8% moisture content. No Player who signs his first Major League contract for the 2013 season or for any subsequent season may order (or have ordered on his behalf) a sugar maple bat that has a wood den- sity less than 0.0245 lbs/in 3   when at 8% moisture content. 5.   Reopener: If (a) the Safety and Health Advisory Committee’s consultant’s report to the Parties that the total number of mul- tiple piece failures increased by at least 20% from the total number reported by the consultants for the prior championship season; or (b) a multiple-piece failure of a bat that, in the con- sultants’ judgment, conforms with the regulations results in a serious injury to a player or any other person on the field or in the stadium, then the Office of the Commissioner shall have 402"},{"page":419,"text":"the right to reopen the Parties’ agreement on bats. For the pur- pose of this provision, a serious injury constitutes an injury that results in (x) a player being placed on an injured list or hospitalized for at least one night; (y) a manager, coach, umpire or other on-field person being rendered unable to per- form services for at least 7 days or hospitalized for at least one night; and (z) a fan or other person in the stadium being hos- pitalized for at least one night. In the event the consultants are unable to determine whether a bat conforms with the regula- tions because they are unable to examine the bat, absent evi- dence to the contrary, the bat will be presumed to have been in compliance. This reopener must be made by October 15 in order to apply to the following championship season. If the Office of the Commissioner exercises the right to reopen, the Parties shall bargain in good faith over changes to the bat regulations to become effective with the following championship season. If the Parties are unable to reach agreement by November 15, Clubs will be prohibited from paying for maple bats with a density lower density lower than 0.0240 lbs/in 3   for the dura- tion of the Basic Agreement. 6.   Netting: During batting practice, all Clubs shall continue to supplement their standard screens on the playing field (e.g., cage, 1B, 3B, and short CF) with temporary screens or netting to better protect fans. The Commissioner’s Office will deter- mine whether a Club has satisfied this requirement after con- sultation with the Players Association. 7.

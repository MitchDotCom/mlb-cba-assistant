For purposes of this Article XVI, full funding of the present value of deferred compensation obligations shall mean that the Club must have funded, for the duration of and without interruption in each year, the current present value of the then outstanding deferred payments, dis- counted by 5% annually.

Morgan Chase Bank on the immediately preceding November 1 is 7% or higher, the Parties shall meet and confer regarding this Article XVI discount rate and may, with due notice to the Clubs, amend such dis- count rate effective the next succeeding July 1. Notwithstanding the above funding requirement, each Club shall be entitled to an annual deductible amount of deferred compensation which need not be funded for Contracts executed before December 11, 2011.

  "Year for purposes of the AAV calculation shall be determined by multiplying that Base Salary by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of championship season days that the Player was paid the Base Salary, and the denominator shall be the number of championship season days in that championship season; and (ii) the first Guaranteed Year shall not be considered a full Guaranteed Year for purposes of the AAV calculation, but shall be considered a partial year equal to the fraction described in subsection (i) above. (3)   Signing Bonuses  Any Signing Bonus in a Uniform Player\u2019s Contract (and any other payment this Article deems to be a Signing Bonus) shall be attributed, pro rata, over the Guaranteed Years of the Contract. If a Contract contains no Guaranteed Years, the Signing Bonus shall be attributed in full to the first year of the Contract. (4)   Performance, Award and Other Bonuses  (a) Any amounts that are actually earned by a Player as Perform- ance Bonuses, Award Bonuses or any other bonuses properly included in a Uniform Player\u2019s Contract shall be included as part of the Player\u2019s Salary in the Contract Year in which the service or per- formance giving rise to the Bonus was provided. Potential bonuses shall not be included in the AAV calculation made pursuant to Sec- tion E(2) above.

The Commissioner will provide the Association with a written statement as part of the consultation process regarding the factors that he considered in making a distribution to a Club. The Commissioner will utilize best efforts to distribute all of the amounts allocated to the Fund within one year, provided that, in his discretion, there are a suf- ficient number of Clubs that merit a distribution from the Fund.

Such a plan must include a pro forma financial presentation that specifies its attendance, revenues, payroll, player develop- ment expenditures, non-player costs, and capital spending. The Commissioner, after consultation with the Players Association, may direct the Club to change aspects of its plan, including the level of competitive effort reflected in the plan, or take other actions as he considers appropriate (including escrow of a portion of a Club\u2019s revenue sharing payments). The Association has the burden in any proceeding under the Grievance Procedure of demonstrating that the Club\u2019s use of its rev- enue sharing receipts was in violation of this subparagraph 5(a). In any such Grievance, the Arbitration Panel shall consider, among other things: (i) the Club\u2019s expenditures on scouting, player devel- opment, and player payroll; (ii) the Club\u2019s long-term strategy for improving competitiveness; (iii) the uses that the Club has histori- cally made of revenue sharing receipts; (iv) any material adverse changes in local revenue; and (v) the overall financial position of the Club. Notwithstanding the above, if a Club\u2019s Actual Club Payroll pursuant to Article XXIII(C) is equal to less than 150% of its rev- enue sharing receipts in a given Revenue Sharing Year, the Club shall have the burden of establishing in any Grievance that its use of revenue sharing receipts was consistent with this subparagraph 5(a). (b) Each Revenue Sharing Payee Club, no later than August 15, shall report on the performance-related uses to which it put its rev- enue sharing receipts in the current Revenue Sharing Year. That report shall include, in a single submission: a statement of the Club\u2019s strategy for competitive improvement, aggregate revenues, payroll, non-payroll costs, and operating profits, both planned and 154",

In the event of a Players Association investigation into a potential violation of Section 5(B)(20), or fraudulent con- duct meant to conceal a violation of Section 5(B)(20), the Com- missioner\u2019s Office and Players Association will meet to discuss the results of the investigation promptly after the later of: (a) the conclusion of the investigation; (b) the issuance of discipline to the agent(s) in question; (c) the resolution of any appeal that arises under the Agent Regulations; or (d) the resolution of any related appeal that arises under the Program. 2.   The information to be shared at a meeting conducted under Para- graph 1 of this agreement shall include a recitation of the perti- nent factual findings, if any. In addition, in the event an agent\u2019s certification is suspended or revoked as the result of an investi- gation described in Paragraph 1 above, the Players Association will provide an explanation of such disposition to the Commis- sioner\u2019s Office. 175",

The media shall have pre-game access to the clubhouse for a minimum of 50 minutes prior to the time that a Club mandates that all play- ers take the field for batting practice or other related activities (e.g., stretching). If a Club does not take batting practice, it may not close the clubhouse until the media has been granted a mini- mum of 50 minutes of access. Unless necessary to satisfy the 50-minute requirement, no Club may provide pre-game access prior to three hours and 30 minutes prior to game time.

This letter shall be admissible in any arbitration hearing involving an issue addressed herein. A Club has the right under Regulation 2 of the Uniform Player\u2019s Con- tract (\u201cUPC\u201d) to designate the doctors and hospitals furnishing medical care and hospital services to a Player for injuries sustained in the course and within the scope of his employment under his UPC. A Player is entitled under Article XIII(D) of the Basic Agreement to go to a doctor on the second medical opinion list for diagnosis and a second medical evaluation of an employment related illness or injury being treated by the Club physician. The Parties have had a disagreement regarding Club and Player rights when a second medical opinion doctor and a Club physician disagree on the appropriate course of treatment for a Player\u2019s employment-related injury, including but not limited to disagreement over whether medical procedures not yet approved by the United States Food   and   Drug Administration   qualify   as   \u201creasonable   medical expenses\u201d under Regulation 2 of the UPC. Without attempting to resolve this disagreement, the Parties will continue to attempt to avoid disputes that might otherwise arise between Players and Clubs in this area by, among other things, urging their constituents to agree upon a qualified third physician expert in the appropriate medical specialty who would resolve the dispute between the Club physician and the sec- ond medical opinion doctor as to the appropriate course of treatment.

Player Advisory Council (\u201cPAC\u201d). The Players on each Club shall establish a PAC. The PAC shall identify acceptable clubhouse stan- dards with respect to meals, nutrition, services, and amenities that should be provided in home and visiting clubhouses. Disputes over whether a Club is meeting acceptable clubhouse standards shall be raised initially by the PAC (or an individual Player) with the Club- house Manager. If the dispute is not resolved after the initial com- plaint, the collective bargaining Parties (with involvement, as needed, from the Joint Strength & Conditioning Coordinator and/or Joint Dietitian Consultant) will consult regarding an accept- able resolution. If this consultation does not resolve the dispute, the Players Association may appeal the dispute through the Grievance Procedure contained in Article XI. 2.   Clubhouse Standards (a)   Cleanliness & Environment. Each Club must satisfy all applicable local and state health cleanliness standards for all food stations (home and visitor). All Club employees or other personnel who handle food must have a food handler\u2019s license, in compliance with any applicable local municipal ordinances. Carpets in both the home clubhouse and visiting clubhouse must be cleaned at least bi-weekly. Bathroom facilities (including toilets, showers and tubs) should be cleaned and disinfected on a daily basis, and there must be adequate ventilation and air freshening with functional heat and air conditioning. 325",

Specifically, we have agreed that a Player who finishes first-or second-place in vot- ing for his League\u2019s Rookie of the Year Award in a season in which that Player qualified as an Eligible Prospect (as defined in Major League Rule 4( l )(1)) entering that season shall be credited with a full year of credited Major League service (i.e., 172 days of Major League service) for that season, irrespective of how many days of credited Major League service he otherwise would have accrued for that season pur- suant to Article XXI of the Basic Agreement. Any ties in Rookie of the Year Award voting shall be broken by which Player received more first-place votes (and, in the event they received the same number of first-place votes, by who received more second- place votes, and so on, until the tie is broken). In the event that an addi- tional tiebreaker is required due to two or more players receiving identical Rookie of the Year voting, the tie(s) will be broken by which Player received the higher WAR total in that season, as calculated by the Pre-Arbitration Committee pursuant to Article XV(D). For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall more than two Players per League (4 total) qualify under this agreement each year. The Association shall have the right to opt-out of this agreement for the following season (and thus the remainder of the Basic Agreement) by providing notice to the Commissioner\u2019s Office on or before the preced- ing December 15. 357",
